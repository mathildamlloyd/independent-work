i upgraded my squeeze box to kde 4.4 about a week ago, and have been 
contending with jumpy, hesitant video performance ever since. i'm not sure 
which package to file this bug against; if it helps i'm running an nvidia 
7900gs using the drivers in the nvidia-glx package. it ran fine with kde 4.3. 
thanks!
