i'm not sure what you mean. what is an "extra" iso?

you mean the full set of cd or dvd images? i find a net install works best 
nowadays. then you just download and install packages as you want to.

the archive is simply huge now so it's a lot to download and burn unless you 
have machines that are not connected to the net that you want to install or 
update.
