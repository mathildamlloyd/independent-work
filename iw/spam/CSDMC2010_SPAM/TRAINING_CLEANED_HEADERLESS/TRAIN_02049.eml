i agree with this statement and to this end i built a sid sandbox to give 
kde4 a whirl.  i've just started but the changes to the whole desktop 
paradigm have me confused.  are desktops vs. activities vs. dashboards 
explained anywhere.  i'd like to assume they are more than candy.  are 
there documents that demonstrate their practical application?  google 
hasn't been my bf on this one.

so far, so confused,
steve
