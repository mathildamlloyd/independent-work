i am running an up to date lenny box with fvwm.  i do not run gnome, or kde.  i want to have removable devices, such as flash drives and mp3 players, automount.  i have read the mini how-to on automounting, but i still can't get it to work.

this is the relevant data:

$ cat /etc/auto.master

#
# $id: auto.master,v 1.4 2005/01/04 14:36:54 raven exp $
#
# sample auto.master file
# this is an automounter map and it has the following format
# key [ -mount-options-separated-by-comma ] location
# for details of the format look at autofs(5).
#/misc  /etc/auto.misc --timeout=60
#/smb   /etc/auto.smb
#/misc  /etc/auto.misc
#/net   /etc/auto.net
/mnt    /etc/auto.mnt



$ cat /etc/auto.mnt
#
# $id: auto.misc,v 1.2 2003/09/29 08:22:35 raven exp $
#
# this is an automounter map and it has the following format
# key [ -mount-options-separated-by-comma ] location
# details may be found in the autofs(5) manpage

#cd             -fstype=iso9660,ro,nosuid,nodev :/dev/cdrom

# the following entries are samples to pique your imagination
linux           -ro,soft,intr           ftp.example.org:/pub/linux
#boot           -fstype=ext2            :/dev/hda1
#floppy         -fstype=auto            :/dev/fd0
#floppy         -fstype=ext2            :/dev/fd0
#e2floppy       -fstype=ext2            :/dev/fd0
#jaz            -fstype=ext2            :/dev/sdc1
#removable      -fstype=ext2            :/dev/hdd
#pen            -fstype=auto            :/dev/sda1
mp3             -fstype=auto            uuid="7ce2-e7ea"
lexar           -fstype=vfat            label="lexar media"



$ /etc/init.d/autofs status
configured mount points:
------------------------
/usr/sbin/automount --timeout=300 /mnt file /etc/auto.mnt

active mount points:
--------------------
/usr/sbin/automount --pid-file=/var/run/autofs/_mnt.pid --timeout=300 /mnt file /etc/auto.mnt


the last two lines in /etc/auto.mnt refer to the devices that i am trying to automount.  i would use uuid for lexar, but it is "0000-0000" and would conflict with other devices.  i unplugged the devices prior to updating the files, the replugged them, but they do not automount.  i made sure that there are no references to the files in /etc/fstab, but still no automounting.  i also tried reloading autofs and then replugging the devices.  nothing.

what am i missing?

all help appreciated.
