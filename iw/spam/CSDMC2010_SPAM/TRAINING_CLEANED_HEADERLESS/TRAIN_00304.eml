i think you should pick up a book that covers mvc in the iphone world.
"beginning iphone 3 development" by dave mark and jefflamarche is
probably your best bet.

that may be worthwhile.  even if you had retained your 2002-era bnr
knowledge, the prevailing use of framework-provided view controllers
in uikit is a pretty significant change with lots of interesting (and
mostly very positive) consequences.  even some cocoa old-timers had a
hard time grasping it at first--i'm living proof!  that being said, i
don't know if bnr is covering a lot of iphone material now (though i
assume that's the case) or if they're still more mac-focused, so check
first.
