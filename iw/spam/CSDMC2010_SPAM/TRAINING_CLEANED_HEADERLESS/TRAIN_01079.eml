hi all,

i have 3 or 4 email addresses (which get used for different
reasons), and i'd prefer not to mix them up. so i was wondering
if anyone knows of a way that i can have mail (apart from list
mail, which i have already sorted) which arrives to a certain
e-mail address have the from: header in the reply automatically
set to the address it came to.

for example, say i have a company, and sales@company.com,
info@company.com and tech@company.com arrive in the same mailbox.
i don't want to reply to sales@company.com mails with the from:
set to dave@company.com, i would like the mail to come from
sales@company.com.

is there any way to do this? bearing in mind that mail can arrive
with my email in the to or cc fields (and bcc?), and it might be
buried in a couple of dozen other recipients...

cheers,
dave.
