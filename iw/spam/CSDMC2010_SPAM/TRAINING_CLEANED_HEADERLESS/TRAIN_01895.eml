look at his e-mail address :-/

this won't be the first time i see problems with user coming from some 
restrictive networks.

there is still another option: "d) other" :-)

many cuban users are not able to browse the web (they have internet but 
only e-mail access, no web browsing) so if that is the case, he cannot 
review the mailing list posts using web archives and if he is not 
receiving e-mails coming from external users (non *.cu addresses), he is 
then stuck.

but i'm just guessing, true is that in the spanish mailing list there are 
some posts coming from him, but *not* replies.
