this is equivalent to "update-rc.d apache2 remove" and will not
persist.  the workaround is to keep at least one stop link, then
update-rc.d will not recreate the symlinks on package upgrades.

in squeeze it is possible to run "update-rc.d disable" and "update-rc.d
enable" to disable or enable a service.
