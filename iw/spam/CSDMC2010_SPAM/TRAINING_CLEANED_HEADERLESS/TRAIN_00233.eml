i was doing a search on some research papers on computer science and
ran across one of the most useful examples of public vertical search portals.
http://hpsearch.uni-trier.de/hp/

it's the home pages of 62,179 computer scientists.
mostly broken, but 50/50 on better title hits than dblp.

one thing that's interesting is that for google's
"similar pages", only one homepage which returns the fork archive is
the page below[1] is he on fork.  other similar pages
include printer toner, home mortgages, and one for the origins of the
prime radiant[2] which i found out is an asmiov concept.

the concept of a prime radiant is that there
is a single interconnected forklist that ties a large number of
decentralized individuals throughout the world who's collective
wisdom is a good model for predicint the future.
