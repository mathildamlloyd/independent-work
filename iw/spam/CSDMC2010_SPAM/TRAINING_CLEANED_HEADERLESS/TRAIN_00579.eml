as far as i know, the proper way to disable a service is to change the=20
sxy link in kxy for the respective runlevel (this can also be done with=20
any of the available runlevel editors, like sysv-rc-conf).

removing all sxy symlinks will result in them being recreated on the=20
next upgrade (as you have experienced).

you can also make changes to the init.d script, but i'm not sure which=20
ones will be detected by dpkg. textual changes will, but don't know=20
about removing the execute bit or the like.
