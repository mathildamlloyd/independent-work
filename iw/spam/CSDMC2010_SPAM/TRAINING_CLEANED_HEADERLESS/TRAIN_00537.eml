as i mentioned in my email to anders, it's certainly in my code and i don't 
have time to work on it right now, so i would not be offended if you worked on 
it.

i just this moment found out that my partner has promised a few things would be 
done before my vacation that will require my efforts, so it's even more true 
that it was when i sent the mail to anders.
