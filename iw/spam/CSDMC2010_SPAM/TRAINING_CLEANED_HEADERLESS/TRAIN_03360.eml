i figured i would pipe up here, because i have a kind of different
perspective here. i have a 42u data center rack in my basement, and about
half a dozen really old servers. they aren't really worth much from a
financial standpoint, but at the same time, i use them as a sort of test
lab. and i have a tripp lite 1000va and an apc backups 1000 (just replaced
the batteries) in the rack. i also have a backups 350 for my workstation.

it's not about the cost of the hardware (as i said, almost everything is 32
bit piii/p4 class hardware that has little to no value in most business
environments (which is how i came by it, by and large), but my data? thats a
whole nother kettle of fish. it may only be important to me, but the point
is that it *is* important to me.
