hi all,

i'll be leaving this evening until next monday, with no access to
whatsoever to a single computer until then, woohoo, real holidays! :-)

so don't be worried if there's a new release of  and that it's not updated quickly despite your many
requests to the list ;-)

before going, i did repackage the latest hackedbox and lbreakout2 that both
came out today.

have fun! (i will!! ;-))
matthias
