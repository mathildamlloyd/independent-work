hello everyone!

according to this tutorial (http://d-i.pascal.at/) i was able to start 
the installation process from usb stick on my:

hp 5700 thin client terminal
1 ghz processor
512 ram
256 internal flash drive

but i get stuck because there is not enough space even for minimal 
installation (netinstall.iso).
now the question:

i have also another 4gb usb stick. can i install the biggest parts of 
the system on it?
if yes, which parts of the filesystem do i need place on internal flash 
memory (ide ata, faster), and
which on the usb stick?

the device will be used as a ftp, nas etc.

thanks on advance
krzysztof
