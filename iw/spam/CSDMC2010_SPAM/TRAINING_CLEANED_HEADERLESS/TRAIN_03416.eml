"of" was a typo

unbreakable would mean here that no one, even previously authorised entity, 
could use the system without paying the periodic subscription fee.

it could be an online system that work 95% offline but poll frequently an 
offsite server.  no mass production cds, maybe mass personalised d/l like sun 
jdk.

nothing is fixed yet, we are looking at the way a software can be protected 
from unauthorized utilisation.  

is the use of "trusted hardware" really worth it ?  does it really make it 
more secure ?  look at the dvds.
