that is troublesome, probably to the point of actually being broken.  it's=

likely that something "behind-the-scenes" in lvm is actually messing with t=
he=20
snapshot device even when it is not mounted and preventing the removal.

i'm fairly sure the snapshot device has to be updated whenever a write is d=
one=20
to a new le in the original device, and it's possible *that* is causing the=
=20
problem.  i hope this issue gets some attention; i doubt it is a debian-ism.

my guess on this one is one of two things:
1) udev is taking a little while to unlink "secondary" names for the lvs th=
at=20
are being removed, and when lvm does its device scan it's hitting "missing"=
=20
devices.
2) lvm is using device names from its cache for devices that are no longer=
=20
present for its device scan and, again, hitting "missing" devices.

in either case i think the error messages are annoying, but not indicative =
of=20
a real problem.
