i didn't say it wouldn't work.  i said it is unsupported.  there's
a difference.  debian does make modifications to the kernel source.
the official debian kernel source packages have been modified by the
debian kernel team after downloading them from kernel.org.  there is
a reason for all of these modifications.  often it's to prune "non-free"
drivers from the kernel source tree.  but there may be other modifications
made for other reasons.  the debian kernel team only supports their
own kernel sources.  if you obtain kernel source code directly from
upstream, and you have problems running it, you will have to seek
support and file bug reports directly with upstream kernel development.
you can't file a bug report against the debian kernel source package
because it's not the debian kernel source.  and you can't ask for
help from the debian kernel team on their list because it's not
their source.  they will have nothing to do with it.  that's what
i mean by unsupported.
