when i make two "local" disks via macfuse and i try to eject one of them =
the finder insists on warning me that there are two drives on the same =
partition, and giving me the option to unmount all of them or just the =
one i tried to. this is very inconvenient for me.

the mount command shows:


myfs@fuse0 on /volumes/myfs_2gig (...)
myfs@fuse1 on /volumes/myfs_4gig (...)

my suspicion is that the finder just looks for the mount=46rom value =
then calls volumes partitions on the same disk if they only vary in the =
last number.

thoughts?

thanks,
jim o'connor=
