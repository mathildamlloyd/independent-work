no...the list has been on target i'd say about 95% of the time.
iff it starts being a problem, consider it. right now, john's
right - this remove thread is taking more time than any remove
requests have in the entire past year.

one thing you may want to consider (if feasible) - bugtraq's
adopted a technique by which they add headers to each message
indicating where to email to remove. the catch: the mail is
not sent to "majordomo" - it is sent to "listname-remove"@domain.
i've found that useful when i can't remember exactly which mail
addr i used to signup (since my email addr never shows up in
a received message, and i have multiple addresses going to the
same box).

for all that, remember, even if you put the actual removal
instructions right in the bottom of your email, you will
_still_ get the clueless asking you how to remove. (trust me,
we've been there.)
