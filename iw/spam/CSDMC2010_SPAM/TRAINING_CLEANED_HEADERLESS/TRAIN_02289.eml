package: bbkeys
version: 0.9.0-7.1
severity: normal

i am not shure if this is for bbkeys or blacbox!
when i run any java program i am not able to switch to it by bbkeys
binding that work for every other program just fine.
in my ~/.bbkeysrc i have:

    [nextwindow]      (mod4-tab)
    [prevwindow]      (mod4-shift-tab)
    [nextworkspace]   (mod4-control-tab)
    [prevworkspace]   (mod4-control-shift-tab)

and it work. it is just java programs are not included in 'switch to...'
window that pops up. to be more concrete i just downloaded 
omegat_2.1.5_beta_linux.tar.bz2 from http://www.omegat.org and this
java program (nor any other window that it create) does not appear in
'switch to...' list. when i click with mouse on the arrow in the
blackbox toolbar it does cycle all opened windows on workspace
(including java programs).
