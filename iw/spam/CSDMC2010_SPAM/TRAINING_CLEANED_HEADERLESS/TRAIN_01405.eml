at a pub frequented by the members of the eu translator corps,
a spanish translator and an irish translator start comparing
notes.  the spanish translator asks, "is there anything in irish
gaelic which corresponds to 'maana'?"  the irishman thinks for
a moment, fortified by a long pull at his pint, and finally
responds, "yes -- but it doesn't have the same sense of terrible
urgency."
