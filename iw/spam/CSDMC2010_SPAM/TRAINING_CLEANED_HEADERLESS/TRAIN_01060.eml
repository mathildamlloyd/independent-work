my laptop has a via c3 processor. i use debian with a self-compiled
2.4.19 kernel, and have had absolutely no problems with the chip at all
(quite the opposite, in fact).

i had to compile for "686" in order for 3d acceleration to work (the
kernel has an option specifically for the via c3), but i assume that was
a kernel problem rather than a hardware problem.
