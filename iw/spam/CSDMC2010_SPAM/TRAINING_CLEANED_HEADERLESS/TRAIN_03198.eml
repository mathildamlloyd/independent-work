i do not agree, sorry. pdflatex generally write bigger pdfs, simply
because there is no compression (consider for example
http://www.tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2004-june/005046.html). moreover, i
think that pstricks does not work with pdflatex (you need to use pdftrick=
s).

i also vaguely remember about many situations where, if i had had to use
pdflatex, i would not have been able to produce the same document,
because i would have had to change many packages which were incompatible.=


you might ask on comp.text.tex, this is a better place for this, because
this is my point of view, and it is not shared by the whole community.
