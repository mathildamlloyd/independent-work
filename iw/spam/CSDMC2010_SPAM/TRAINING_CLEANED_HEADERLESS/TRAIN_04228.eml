hi,

on my netbook i'm using automatic usb sticks mount through udev rules,
and i already used to running 'sync' command before unplugging stick,
so no data will be lost. but if i have few sticks inserted and some
information copying on one of them, if i run 'sync' i have to wait
while copying ends, because:

a) sync command drops cache on disk, but copying process fill it
again; sync will work until all the caches are dropped to disks
b) i can't unplug stick when it stops to flash because i can't be sure
that there are no more parts of cache needed to be flushed on that
disk.

so here is my question - how can i run sync for only one device?

with best regards,
alexander batischev
