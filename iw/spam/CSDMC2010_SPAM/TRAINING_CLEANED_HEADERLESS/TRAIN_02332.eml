i'm not trying to load an instance of the class, i'm trying to load the 
actual class definition.  the error is telling me that the java 
classloader can't find that class on the classpath (at least that's my 
understanding).  what i don't understand is, for it to have called the 
static initializer, that means java has already loaded the class 
definition, right?  so why can't it find it?
