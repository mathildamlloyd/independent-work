i don't want to reinstate this discussion, but i just found sth which i haven't heard/read about 
before, which might help you (haven't tried it myself).

i just started the akonadi tray utility, then right-clicked on the tray icon and chose configure...
the second tab, labelled "akonadi server configuration" has a setting for database driver, which 
allows you to choose between mysql and ... postgresql
with postgresql selected, you can specify your database settings.

maybe that helps.
