thanks!

in the past i tried "lilo -u /dev/hda" and it wouldn't work -- an
original copy of the mbr must be in /boot directory for it to work. 
which is exactly what i didn't have.  the installation of linux
mandrake didn't afford me that luxury.

also, i'm glad you cleared up the fdisk issue.  i know better now --
previously i was under the impression that fdisk had a hidden switch. 
this is obviously not the case.
