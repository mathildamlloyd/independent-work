if i understand correctly, you cannot find executable.
i encountered similar on my bsd box, when file changed
the name to firefox3. after a bit of climbing up and
falling down, the answer has shown.
if the question is: what is an alternative to firefox,
i could say: conkeror. depends on libxul. almost the
same look and feel, but no tables nor bars. i recompiled
from the source both lib and the browser. i assume for
debian already may be found the binary file.
if i missed the point, sorry.
