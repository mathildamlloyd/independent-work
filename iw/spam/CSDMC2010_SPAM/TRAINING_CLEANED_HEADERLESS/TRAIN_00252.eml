this specific application plays movies in a loop.

there are no problems when i use the following qtmoviedidendnotification =
notification handler:

- (void)moviedidend: (nsnotification *)notification
{
[self performselectoronmainthread: @selector(startnextmovie) =
withobject: null waituntildone: no];
}

however qtkit does not release the qtmovie objects when i use the gcd =
version:

- (void)moviedidend: (nsnotification *)notification
{
dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
[self  startnextmovie];
});
}

-(void) startnextmovie
{
[movieview setmovie: [self nextmovie]];
}

now comes the weird part, the qtmovie objects are released when the user =
interacts (click in menubar/window etc) with the application.

since this is a kiosk application that never happens and after a while =
the application simply runs out of memory.

i this a known issue?
