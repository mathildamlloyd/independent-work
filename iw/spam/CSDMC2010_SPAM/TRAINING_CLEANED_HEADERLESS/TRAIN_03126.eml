did anyone managed to boot from raid1?

lenny gives this error message:

"mdadm: no devices found for /dev/md0"

i just want to install debian lenny on two pendrives [in sraid1], so
that the hdd's in the pc can be used only as ""data containers"", but it
gives this error message.

please help me.

thank you!
