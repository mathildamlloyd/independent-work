sorry if i'm being dense, i said i'm not a networking expert.  but i 
have thought about this, and i am not seeing how it wouldn't work.

192.168.11.1 is:
11000000 10101000 00001011 00000001

192.168.11.55 is:
11000000 10101000 00001011 00110111

so, the computer at 192.168.11.55 will think it's subnet is the first 22 
bits of the address, which is 11000000 10101000 000010, which matches 
the first 22 bits of the router address.  so far so good.  client side 
will think the machine at 192.168.11.1 is on the same ip subnet, so it 
will do an arp request for 192.168.11.1 (arp doesn't care about subnet 
masks, it just does an ethernet broadcast), which will succeed, and the 
server will be able to send to the router.  the reverse direction is 
also true.

what am i missing?
