argh!! i did upgrade to acroreat 9.3.1 from multimedia unstable upon
these responses and the referenced article which was based upon 9.x.  i
even set a lid_library_path variable in case it was not a typo.  it
still doesn't work.  setting the command line debugging variable, i
found that it cannot find the ppd file.  does it only work if the cups
server is running locally? in our case, we use a central cups server
running on a non-standard port.  this is reflected
in /etc/cups/client.conf.  how do we tell acroread where the printer
server and ppd files are? thanks - john
