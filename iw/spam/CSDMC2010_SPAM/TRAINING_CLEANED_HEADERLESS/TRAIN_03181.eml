what do you want to achieve in this thread on this debian-kde user support=
=20
mailinglist?

resurrecting kde 3.5 for debian?

well did you?

if not, i suggest you to try it elsewhere.

possible places are:

=2d debian-qt-kde@lists.debian.org since that is where development of debia=
n=20
kde packages is coordinated

=2d trinity desktop environment / vector linux

this is for kde user support. kde 3.5 in lenny. kde 4 in squeeze unless=20
someone - except the current debian kde / qt developer team - does and=20
maintains kde 3.5 packages that are co-installable and meet debians high=20
packaging standards.

this list is not for development issues like developing / maintaining kde=20
3.5 packages for squeeze.

so imho any further request for kde 3.5 in squeeze is off topic on this=20
list as debian kde/qt maintainers repeatedly said they won't.

you want kde 3.5 for squeeze? spend your energy towards that goal. here it=
=20
apparently does not change the situation.

ciao,
