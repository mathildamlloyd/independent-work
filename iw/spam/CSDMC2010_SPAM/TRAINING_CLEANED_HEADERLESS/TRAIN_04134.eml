it might just be me, but when i head "usb-serial adaptor" i think of
something like a pl2303 which can be used to attach devices with a
serial connector to a pc that lacks a serial port. it would be news to
me if these adaptors worked the other way round, too.

but if it actually works, you should be able to talk to the device using
the regular /dev/ttys0.
