  | i can't reproduce this error.

for me it is very repeatable... (like every time, without fail).

this is the debug log of the pick happening ...

18:19:03 pick_it {exec pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace} {4852-4852 -sequence mercury}
18:19:03 exec pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace 4852-4852 -sequence mercury
18:19:04 ftoc_pickmsgs {{1 hit}}
18:19:04 marking 1 hits
18:19:04 tkerror: syntax error in expression "int ...

note, if i run the pick command by hand ...

delta$ pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace  4852-4852 -sequence mercury
1 hit

that's where the "1 hit" comes from (obviously).  the version of nmh i'm
using is ...

delta$ pick -version
pick -- nmh-1.0.4 [compiled on fuchsia.cs.mu.oz.au at sun mar 17 14:55:56 ict 2002]

and the relevant part of my .mh_profile ...

delta$ mhparam pick
-seq sel -list


since the pick command works, the sequence (actually, both of them, the
one that's explicit on the command line, from the search popup, and the
one that comes from .mh_profile) do get created.

ps: this is still using the version of the code form a day ago, i haven't
been able to reach the cvs repository today (local routing issue i think).
