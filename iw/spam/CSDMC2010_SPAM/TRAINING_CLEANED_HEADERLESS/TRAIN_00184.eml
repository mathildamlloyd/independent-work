hi,

this might appear as a very strange email. maybe it is ;)

i'm french, and i'm currently studying in a engineer school in france,
called utbm (http://www.utbm.fr). next year, from february to july, i have
to do a practice somewhere in the world (in france or elsewhere).

i'm a linux user and developer since a couple of years now (i coordinate the
kos project, http://kos.enix.org). that's why i'm looking for a practice in
which i can use linux and/or develop linux/bsd software. i also prefer
working in a small company (< 100 people). but since i've never been to
ireland (that's why i want to discover this country), and since i have no
contact there, it is very difficult to find companies.

so, i thought that the local linux community maybe was able to help me by
giving some list of companies that are known to work with linux/bsd or any
other free software.

thank you very much for your help

thomas
