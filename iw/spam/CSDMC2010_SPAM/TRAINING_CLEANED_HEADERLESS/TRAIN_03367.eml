what release of debian are you using?  lenny?  squeeze?  sid?

i've experienced what you describe before, mainly because older releases
of debian used the lpr/lpd printing setup, and i used apsfilter to
install printer drivers.  then when i switched to a newer release of
debian that used cups, and foomatic did not have a driver for the printer,
especially for older or less popular printers.

http://www.linuxprinting.org and http://www.cups.org are good places
to start looking for documentation.
