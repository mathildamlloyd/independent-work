i need to play two movies in sync, compositing them in a custom way. 
one approach i came up with is to put the movies in qtmovielayers (core 
animation), and then i can use a core image filter for the compositing. 
  does that sound reasonable, or is there another approach that is 
likely to perform significantly better?
