shortly after i turn utf-8 on xterm will crash for no apparent reason. =
it doesn't have to be utf-8 characters. simply turn on utf-8 and do =
"find /" and there it goes. i can reproduce this 100% of the time.

(if this is not the right list for this, a pointer to the right list =
would be appreciated.)
