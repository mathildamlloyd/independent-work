hi all,

after about a fortnight, i tried to update my debian squeeze desktop,
and i was using the mirror.cse.iitk.ac.in mirror. after downloading
the repository lists, it tells me there are no updates -- i am
surprised as i know that gnome 2.30 is already in testing. thinking
that it could be a problem with the mirror, i switch to
ftp.ch.debian.org and update. this time, it does say there are about
300 updates.

i issue a safe-upgrade, but the electricity goes out just as the
updates begin downloading. after i turn the computer back on, issuing
a safe-upgrade shows there are no updates! i try to aptitude update
but it thinks that the repositories are already updated, though
apt-cache show nautilus gives the version 2.28.4. as i was in a hurry
at the time, i just deleted /var/lib/apt/lists, so aptitude had no
choice but to really download the lists. after this the safe-upgrade
proceeded as usual. i realised after deleting /var/lib/apt/lists that
i should have kept a copy, but too late.

though the problem is (in a sense) solved, i am curious as to how this
(bug?) could have occurred. after all this i checked
mirror.cse.iitk.ac.in  and it does have nautilus 2.30.1, so maybe the
first no-updates scenario was also caused by this bug/problem.
