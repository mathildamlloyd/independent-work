i bought a webcam:

bus 006 device 004: id 093a:2622 pixart imaging, inc. 

what should i do, to bring it to life?

i installed cheese, but it doesn't gives any video.

/dev/video doesn't exists.

is there a script that installs all the webcam drivers?

or how to find out, what drivers does it need?

thank you.
