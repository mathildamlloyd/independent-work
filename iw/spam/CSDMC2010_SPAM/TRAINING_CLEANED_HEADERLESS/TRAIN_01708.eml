since you seem fine with raid 6, i'll assume you are also fine with raid 5.

i don't know what your requirements / levels of paranoia are, but raid 5 is=
=20
probably better than raid 6 until you are up to 6 or 7 drives; the chance o=
f a=20
double failure in a 5 (or less) drive array is minuscule.

modern mdadm can migrate from raid 5 to raid 6 when you add the 6th/7th dri=
ve=20
into the array.

also modem mdadm has a wealth of raid 1/0 features that may actually be a=20
better performance-wise than raid 5 or raid 6.

this one.

sorry.

you can add the failed device back into the array and it will re-sync until=
=20
there is another issue with the device.  just be sure to remember which dev=
ice=20
needs replacing for when your new hw arrives.
