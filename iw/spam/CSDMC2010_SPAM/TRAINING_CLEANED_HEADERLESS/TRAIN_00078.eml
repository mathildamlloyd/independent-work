hi folks,

i've been trying to set a button called which automatically
forwards mail using a '-form mycomps' without going through
the editor, but so far haven't got the right recipe.

i currently have in my .exmh-defaults:

*mops.spam.text:        spam
*mops.spam.command:     msg_forward -form spamcomps -noedit -nowhatnowproc ; msg
_remove


i've also tried with "seditsend {$draft $t 0}" after the forward command.
it should forward to a spam address (where filters get adjusted) and then
delete.  it does so, but not without producing the edit window.

any help appreciated.
