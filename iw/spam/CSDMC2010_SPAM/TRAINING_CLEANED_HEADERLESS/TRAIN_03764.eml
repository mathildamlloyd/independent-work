i wish i could answer your question but my laptop does not have the digital stuff
hooked up :( so i so not know about it. i have an excellent ess maestro3 which oss
supports pretty lame so i was forced to learn about alsa.

i have used these commands to explore alsa and my chip:

arecord -l   (list devices)
arecord -l   (list pcm decices)

i get some output like this:

> arecord -l
card 0: maestro3 [ess allegro pci], device 0: allegro [allegro]
  subdevices: 1/1
  subdevice #0: subdevice #0

> arecord -l
pcm list:
 (snip - craploads of output)

i noticed that the output from this commands kind of maps to what the alsamixer or
gamix have.

for what it is worth, here is what i have in modules.conf for my sound stuff:

> ## alsa portion
> alias char-major-116 snd
> ## oss/free portion
> alias char-major-14 soundcore
>

> alias snd-card-0 snd-maestro3

hope that helps, good luck.

that's "angle" as in geometry.
