i have noticed that when printing multi-page pdf files from evince on 
the gnome desktop, using cups under debian lenny, i get a blank page
after every page.  my printer is an hp paintjet.  this wastes paper and
is very annoying.  i have searched the internet, of course, but i did
not find any solutions.  the closest i found was debian bug report 316392,
but his work-around doesn't work for me.  my ppd file already specifies
letter instead of a4 for page size.  does anyone know a work-around for
this?  surely someone has run across this before.
