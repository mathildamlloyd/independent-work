[0]rochlin writes "looks like the perl journal might not make it up for
air after all. this blurb is on [1]their website. 'time is running short
and we need your help if the perl journal is to get another chance at
being the real deal. as of a couple of minutes ago, we only have 881
subscriptions and the deadline is fast approaching. please subscribe now.
it only costs 3 cents per day to get the best perl coverage anywhere.'"
they need 3,000 subscribers to move forward.
