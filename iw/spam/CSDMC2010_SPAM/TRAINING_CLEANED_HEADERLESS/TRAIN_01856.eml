search for a thread named "policykit authorization (system settings) crashes every time"
first msg can be found here: http://lists.debian.org/debian-kde/2009/12/msg00073.html
and it continues here: http://lists.debian.org/debian-kde/2010/03/msg00087.html

it is indeed an issue with kde 4.4 and has to do with the switch to policykit-1, which is in review 
and will/should be included (again) with kde 4.5
