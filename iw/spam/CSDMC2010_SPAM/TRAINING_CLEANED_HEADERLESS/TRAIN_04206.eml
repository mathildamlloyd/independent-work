note the device "mount" options, automatically added by hal:

***
/dev/sdc1 on /media/disk type vfat (rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=hal,shortname=lower,uid=1000)
***

nosuid, nodev, uhelper=hal, uid=1000

maybe the perms of the op's device are wrong :-?

we still don't know if "umount" works when logged with another user in a 
gnome session :-?
