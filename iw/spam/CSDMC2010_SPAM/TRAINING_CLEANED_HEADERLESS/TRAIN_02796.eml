    i'm in your same shoes- i can get it upgraded and all, but i can never seem to work out where to start out with the thing; it strikes me as confusing!  but to be fair, i appreciate the pipline idea; just as it's useful on the commandline, it'll be emensely powerful for manipulating multimedia, too.    it's just not easy yet.  i'm sure all kindsa glade-produced front-ends will come up for it soon, though.  and the docs are complete, too...
