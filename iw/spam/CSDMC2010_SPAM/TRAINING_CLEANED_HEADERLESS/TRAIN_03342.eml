=46irst its imho.

second its from what i understood about the different purposes of debian-
kde and qt-kde-ml mailing lists.

and debian-kde is clearly sorted as users mailing list:

debian in kde
http://lists.debian.org/users.html

debian-qt-kde: packages using qt and/or kde
http://lists.debian.org/devel.html

so i think my view is not that far off.

so or so: your posts did not seem to me to bring anyone even the slightest=
=20
bit forward towards having kde 3.5.

so i finish with a suggestion, how this can work:

=2d--------------------------------------------------------------------
hi developers and users of debian in kde,

i set up an alioth project repository of kde 3.5 packages that i forward-
ported to squeeze at:

http://some-alioth-url

right now i started just with the forward port of the basic kde packages.

i like to continue that work and to make the package co-installable with=20
kde 4.=20

i appreciate any helping hand. if you are a user and want to use kde 3 i=20
encourage you to try may package. please note they are not co-installable=20
with kde 4 in the moment. if you are a developer please help me with=20
building and polishing packages.

if you want to help out, subscribe to mailinglist xyz.

regards,
mike
=2d--------------------------------------------------------------------

now, how about that, mike? how about being the change you want to achieve?

thanks.

note: kde 3.5 doesn't really need to be co-installable for those only=20
interested in kde 3.5. at least not initially.

just a small start might pull this off for you. but if you do not *act*,=20
probably nothing will happen. you can't change those who are not=20
interested in providing kde 3.5 for debian squeeze. so either you start=20
pulling it off for yourself or it - unless someone else feels the=20
motivation to do it - *will just not happen*.

its as easy as that.

ciao,
=2d-=20
