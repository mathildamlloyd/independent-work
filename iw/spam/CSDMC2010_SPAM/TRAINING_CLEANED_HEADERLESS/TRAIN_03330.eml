easy.

first, you'll have to excuse me as i'm still using 2.3.1 (*), so, this
may not play well with recent changes.  (i did look at 2.5.1, too).
and, i just did this off the top of my head (i wanted to see if it
(**) still worked), so this is somewhat untested.

adding a menu entry is trivial; add this to your ~/.exmh/exmh-defaults:

*fops.more.m.uentrylist:ketchup
*fops.more.m.l_ketchup:catch-up all b4 cur
*fops.more.m.c_ketchup: my_mark2curseen

then you just need to provide the source for my_mark2curseen and 
arrange for exmh to include it (put it in your ~/.tk/exmh directory
in your user.tcl; or in pick.patch if you enable the "source hook"
under prefs->hacking support)

it's going to look something like this:

proc my_mark2curseen {} {
    global exmh pick msg
    exmh_status "clearing unseen up to cur..." red
    mh_setcur $exmh(folder) $msg(id)
    set pick(ids) [...get message ids for "pick 1-cur"...]
    busy pickmarkseen
    exmh_status ok blue
}

(that's based upon the guts of pick_markseen)

you need to fill in the code for the [...get...] section; i ran out of
time!
