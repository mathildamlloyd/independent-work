hi,

when watching videos locally, with vlc, it often lags at some parts of
the videos, and the following kinds of messages are displayed at the
console:

==
[some time] main video output error: picture [hexadecimal ref.] refcount is -1
overflow in spectral rle, ignoring
==

the [some time] references are often ~40 times separated, i.e. i could
get

==
[00000010] main video output error: picture [hexadecimal ref.] refcount is -1
[00000050] main video output error: picture [hexadecimal ref.] refcount is -1
.
.
.
==

it does not only happen with  files (.mkv). (i here
test if gnus supports cyrillic out-of-the-box.)

is it normal? does it happen often with videos? what would it be due
to? are they corrupted?

thanks.
