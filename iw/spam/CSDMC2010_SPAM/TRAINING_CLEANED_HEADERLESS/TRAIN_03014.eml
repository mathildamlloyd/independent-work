hi,

let's say that you have two internet connections at home, and
consequently two devices which link your computer to the internet. how
can you manage, e.g. in iceweasel/ff, to use one or the other? if you
have multiple downloads all the time, it might be an interesting thing
to split them among the diferent connections.
