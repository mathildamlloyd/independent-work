hi michael,
                           .rmf and .mid files work fine for me with the =
javasound demo that is shipped under :

/developer/extras/java/sound/javasounddemo/

the javasound demo that is on this site is old and buggy :

> http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/sound/samples/javasounddemo/

when running it, it fails with an error in the demo : (this is a demo =
bug, which we fixed in our demo code)

exception in thread "juke" java.lang.nullpointerexception
at juke.setgain(juke.java:464)
at juke.playsound(juke.java:301)
at juke.run(juke.java:410)
at java.lang.thread.run(thread.java:637)

please use the demo from /developer/extras/java/sound/javasounddemo/.

both .mid and .rmf files play fine. as of update 1, we also support =
external midi devices.

thanks,
bino george,
java runtime engineer,
apple inc.
