i have a small bashscript which prepares a dual-monitor setup for my 
laptop, since i'm moving in and out of the office and meetings, i tend 
to attach and disconnect the monitor a few times a day.

that works fine with xrandr, but the issue is that i would like some 
gnome panels to move, and add one to the extra monitor. i have googled 
around but cant seemt o find that it would be possible, but it must be 
in some way, us usual. so, any hints?

basically, add one panel to one monitor, and add a window list to that 
panel.

best regards,
   eric
