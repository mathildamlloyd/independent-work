  every time i jumped to bed with a girl, i thought,
  "please, don't fall down, lovestick!"


what a stress. and, to make it clear, sometimes my words didn't
  help.

  then i visited this e-store,
  tried blue pilules and understood, why there are so many stories
  around it. i just recommend you to try. fistful of dollars will
  bring you desire!
