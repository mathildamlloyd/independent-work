"currently, i am doing some research for the telivision programme 
"an tuath nua"  (which is broadcast by tg4) , and i saw that the
linux beer hike will be in doolin this year. we'd be intrested 
in including a report on the hike in the programme - will yourself
or anyone else with irish be on the hike do you know ?

thanks for your help."
