i currently have 3 tb of data with another 1tb on its way fairly
soon, so 4 drives will become 5 quite soon. also, i have read that a
common rating of drive failure is an unrecoverable read rate of 1
bit in 10^14 - that is 1 bit in every 10tb. while doing a rebuild
across 4 or 5 drives that would mean it is likely to hit an
unrecoverable read. with raid 5 (no redundancy during rebuild due to
failed drive) that would be game over. is this correct?
