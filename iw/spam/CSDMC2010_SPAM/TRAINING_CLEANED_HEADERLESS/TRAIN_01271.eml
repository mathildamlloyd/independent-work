intel also had a similar device a couple of years ago (netstructure).  they have, afaik, abandoned it.

intel is still in the xml hardware game though.  on 8/19 they spun off a company named tarari.   tarari develops hardware to check the headers of ip packets. tarari calls 
this layer 7 processing (atop the osi model).    from what i can tell, tarari plans to combine virus scanning and xml acceleration into a single hardware device.
