"spamassassin killed my independence day party"

with all the spam that gets through, i had no idea
a filter was in effect at the fork listserv. 

turn it off! it not only risks silent false 
positives, but suffers them in such a way that 
individuals cannot adjust/detect/remedy them. 

also, anti-spam startups need end-users. 
centralized spam fighting takes food out
of those coders' mouths!

i still think self-add whitelists are underrated. 
a fork whitelist would presumably start with
all subscribers, and grow from there. bouncing
problem mail, in a way that humans can understand
how to whitelist themselves for a resend, avoids 
the problem of silent failures without opening the 
door to lazy, forged-"from" spammers.
