this is not a kernel bug, but the way debian uses drivers.  there are
two different drivers in the kernel now.
old ide drivers and newer pata drivers.  old ide drivers are going to
get deprecated.
for some reason debian stock kernel is taking only ide drivers.  i
have seen this with both my desktop (ide amd74xx used, pata_amd is not
at all compiled) and laptop (both ide piix and pata ata_pii modules
are compiled, but ide piix used)
because of that my hard drive is shown as /dev/hda instead of /dev/sda
with the debian stock kernel.

what i did was to compile a custom kernel by including only the pata driver=
s.
now with this custom kernel everything is fine and consistent.
