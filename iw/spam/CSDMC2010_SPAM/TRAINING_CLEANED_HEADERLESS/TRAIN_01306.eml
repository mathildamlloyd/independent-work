ok. it looks like you haven't run the latest make-kpkg.

i just did a rebuild of an existing built source tree. the make-kpkg
output contained 8839 lines of output just to describe unlinking things
in the debian/... directory. that 8839 lines is about 980kb. there was
later objcopy output from the make-kpkg process amounting to 180kb. the
rest of the output is 73kb. it's a significant difference.
