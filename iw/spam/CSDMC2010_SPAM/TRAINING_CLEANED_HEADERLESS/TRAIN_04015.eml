put the commands in .gnomerc (for gnome only) or .xsessionrc (for all x
sessions). if you want to start graphical applications, put the
appropriate .desktop files in ~/.config/autostart, or use the gnome
session manager for the purpose. as others have pointed out, the file
.xsession should be reserved for starting an x session.
