well, unicode, specifically the utf-8 encoding, is generally the standard for
modern linux systems. of course, as long as you are using only characters
that are in ascii, utf-8 is compatible... there is also gb 18030, china's
unicode encoding, but again, it is ascii compatible.

the win32, .net and java platforms all use utf-16/usc-2 (it's complicated)
natively, which is not ascii and is not ascii compatible.

joel's unicode article is from 2003, but still very useful:
