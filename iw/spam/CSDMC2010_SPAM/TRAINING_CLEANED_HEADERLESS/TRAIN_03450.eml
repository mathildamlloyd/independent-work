the way to debug something like this is to turn on the log (preferences 
-> hacking support -> debug log enabled) and track the gpg commands 
being issued and the responses.

fwiw, using exmh 2.5 and gpg 1.0.7 i do not have problems sending 
encrypted messages to myself. when i select the message, an xterm 
window pops up asking for the passphrase. i don't recall exmh ever 
asking me for the passphrase from the tty that started exmh nor from a 
dialog box. (but then again, i'm not a heavy gpg user).
