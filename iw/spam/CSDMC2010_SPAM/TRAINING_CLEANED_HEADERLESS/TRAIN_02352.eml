  | i can cut'n'paste from exmh's message display window into spawned
  | gvim processes, but not into anything else.

that's odd.  i cut & paste between all kinds of windows (exmh into
mozilla, xterm, another wish script of mine i use for dns tasks (but
that one i guess is to be expected) netscape (when i used to use it,
but i suppose it and mozilla are the same codebase, approx) - in fact
i can't thing of anything it fails for, that i have noticed.

what is an example of an "anything else" that it fails for for you?
