just for the record, i am experiencing similar problems: x (or kde) becomin=

almost unusably slow. fwiw, i have a lenovo z61m with a radeon mobility x14=

chipset.

when i'm just working on the notebook display, everything is fine usually, =

when i connect a separate display, performance decreases a lot.

suspend works fine for me, though. with 4.4.2, i even get a nice notificati=

that the display settings have changed afer having plugged the notebook in =
