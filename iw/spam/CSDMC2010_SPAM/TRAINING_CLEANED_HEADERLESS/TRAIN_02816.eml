until a few days ago, razor (sdk 2.03, client 2.12) was catching a
decent set of spams.  it seems now, however, that it isn't catching
anything.  i got one email this morning with "adv:" in the subject
another two or three about how many inches longer i can be.  did i
miss something recently perhaps regarding configuration changes, etc?

thanks in advance,

joe
