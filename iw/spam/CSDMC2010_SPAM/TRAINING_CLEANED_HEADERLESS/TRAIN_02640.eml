it is on a fast moving target, and especially in the case of a major
release. many improvements are rolled into the recent 6.x release.

if debian isn't going to keep up with the current trunk; then there
really is no point in packaging it here. as it stands i'm not going to
go backwards a full version, so i have reverted to the ppa builds.

i don't feel that it's necessary to package it daily, but
weekly should be done as that's the release cycle that google-chrome
developer version usually follows.

for those of use that also use debian on a desktop/laptop besides a
server; using old versions isn't usually desireable on the
workstations where stability isn't as necessary as that of a
production server.
