this sounds like something piggy in the 'flist' code - i'm seeing flist
in general taking 5-10 seconds.  interesting that a different wish comes up
fast, there might be a borkedness in 8.4.

i've been seeing this as well - *usually* with inbox, but it's gotten
stuck on some other folders as well (i have procmail do rcvstore into folders
for me).
