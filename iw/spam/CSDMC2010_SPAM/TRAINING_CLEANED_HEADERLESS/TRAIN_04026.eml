use the gui and don't delete files, use the other option, whats it called
again, the dustbin or something ;-)

conor who only knows about symbolic links ;-))

i'm pretty sure that i have a softlink from
/mnt/public/mnt/public/downloads/linux/wastecpu/setiathome to
/home/cwynne/seti

the /mnt/pub....../seti.. directory resides on an external raidvolume and
/home/../seti is on the internal ide2 drive. 
so i dont have to cd around the gaf. i suppose that would count as across
different devices. 

if you're wondering [probably not] why /mnt/public is there twice, its
because i restored from tapebackup and i didn't know that it keeps the
directory structure. i know now ;-)

actually, how can i fix that quickly and easily? i thought about firstly
mv'ing the structure to /tmp. then copying it back again but i'm sure some
wee genius knows a quickie solution. mind you i never even bothered trying a
its not a priority now that its all linked anyway.

--------------------------------
 hum.  interesting variation on the classic technique of
 redefining `rm' to `mv' the files into `./.trash/' (or
 with a prefix of `#' or a suffix of `~'; the variations
 are endless).  these classic techniques only provide a
 means to roll back accidental `rm's, so there is still
 considerable scope for data lost as there are other ways
 of deleting files --- which is not a problem for this
 hard link idea.

 but, like the classic techniques, there is no rolling
 back of accidental overwrites.

 ( rolling back overwrites reminds me of the "snapshot"
  facility on network appliance fileservers.  and of the
  various "versioning" filesystems which appeared --- and
  then vanished? --- over the years.... )

 one severe(?) gotcha is some files shouldn't have any
 hard links.  both rcs *,v (and hence cvs) and sccs s.*
 files are like this --- the rcs(/cvs?)/sccs toolsets
 complain if there are hard links.
