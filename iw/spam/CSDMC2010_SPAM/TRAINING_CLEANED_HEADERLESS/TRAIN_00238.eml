i am running lxde on squeeze and am keeping it up to date.  i recently noticed that i can not log out of a session.  trying to do so results in no response at all.  i can shut down, or reboot without any problems, but logout does nothing.  i don't know if this started after the full-upgrade that i did last monday (which caused other lxde problems) or not, as i don't think i had tried to do a logout on this system before then.  this isn't a big issue, as it is on my laptop, on which i am the only user and i am usually either logged in and working, or the system is shut down.  i am primarily worried that this is a symptom of some other problem that i have not yet noticed.  any ideas what could be causing this?
