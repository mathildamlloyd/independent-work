hi,

i don't have kde installed (fvwm instead) but use konsole.

that has a warning funcion that shows up with a message 'kde system 
notifications'.

it used to have a sound associated with it and i used to use kontrol to 
set that up. but kontrol is gone.

how do i get sound back for that notification?

i thought i had asked this question before but i can't find it.

hugo
