seriously consider using raid 6. if you use raid 5 then the
probability of an unrecoverable read error (ure) occurring while
rebuilding the 4tb of data is imo a little too high. with raid 6 it
would require 2 ure's that happen to be located in the same raid
segment on both disks - the odds of that are extremely low.
