well, (a) you don't have to upgrade, and (b) what you are doing has never
been safe in the first place because spamassassin 2.31-and-before doesn't
do any kind of file locking while it writes to the mailbox and doesn't
promise to return the proper failure code on disk-full conditions, etc.

if you're still willing to live with (b), all you need is a little shell
script to run spamassassin:

----------
#!/bin/sh
# call this file "spamassassin-wrapper" and chmod +x it
{
echo "from $1 `date`"
sed -e '1{/^from /d;}' | spamassassin
echo ''
} >> $mail
----------

and then use

fetchmail --mda 'spamassassin-wrapper %f'

and you should be all set.
