the kernel from lenny-backports, testing, or sid will probably be using the=
=20
same device naming as ubuntu.

likely it is not using uuids trying to be compatible with initramfs-es or=20
other systems that don't like them.  but, as you've seen, using the "raw"=20
device name doesn't really help either.  different kernel versions, and eve=
n=20
kernels compiled with different options, will use different "raw" names for=
=20
the devices.  in odd setups, the device name might change from boot to boot=
 as=20
devices are (now) discovered asynchronously so they may be assigned names i=
n a=20
different order based how quickly they respond to the kernel.
