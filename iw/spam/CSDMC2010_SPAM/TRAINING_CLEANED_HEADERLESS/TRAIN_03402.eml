please, please, don't do this.

in 4.4, kmail depends on mysql-server in order to send mail. (kmail -> akon=

=2d> mysql-server).

in 4.3, this is not true.  from what i hear on upstream mailing lists, this=
=20
won't be true in 4.5.  upstream is already aware and working on the issue, =
but=20
it falls under "new feature" so it won't be included in the 4.4.x line.

=46or me, kde 4.4 is the most broken kde release since 4.1 (i didn't try 4.=
0). =20
i'd rather have 4.3.x in squeeze than 4.4.

actually, i like most of kde 4.4 and am currently using it for day-to-day=20
work.  i'm still using kmail/kontact/etc. (basically kdepim) from 4.3 since=
 i=20
have no desire to run yet another rdbms on my system.  (i already run=20
postgresql, and have a number of apps that use sqlite installed.)

please don't force an "akonadi-enabled" pim suite on stable users before th=
ey=20
are provided with an akonadi that can use something other than mysql.
