hi all

=46rom time to time i have to assess flash projects, and to assist my =
marking a few years ago i wrote a program which uses a scanner to open =
the .fla file and read it on a "line by line" basis.  although this is =
really stretching what a scanner should do, it has proven surprisingly =
useful over the years.

my original version of the software was written with an "old" xcode =
style project using the now deprecated jam.  recently i decided i needed =
to make some changes to it and i thought it would be a good move to =
transfer it to netbeans --- and it didn't work!  the scanner wouldn't =
read a .fla file when run from netbeans, but it would when run from =
xcode, using either a jam or ant type project.  it would also work if i =
navigated to the netbeans "dist" folder and double clicked the jar =
directly. =20

the following code shows the problem:

      string fullfilename =3d "/users/boblang1/desktop/xxx.fla";
     =20
      try {
        scanner in =3d new scanner (new file (fullfilename));
        while (in.hasnextline ()) {
          string line =3d in.nextline ();
          system.out.println (line);
        }
      }
      catch (exception e) {
        system.out.println ("exception reading file: " + fullfilename);
        system.out.println (e);
      }

when run inside xcode or by double clicking the jar, the scanner reads =
the .fla file.  when run inside netbeans, it appears to open the file =
but won't return any lines (the while loop terminates early).  there are =
no exceptions reported. =20

btw, the problem only seems to happen with .fla files.  i can read .txt =
files quite successfully.

i'm running fully up to date snow leopard, with the latest developer =
preview java. as far as i can tell, i don't have any older versions of =
java on my computer.  all the versions in /system/library appear to link =
to java 1.6.=20

any ideas?

bob
