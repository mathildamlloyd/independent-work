thanks, florian.

unfortunately, dpkg was too broken, so i had to use ubuntu livecd (because  
i could not find dpkg at debian installer cd / rescue mode) to boot and do  
following:

  1. mount -t ext2 /dev/sdax /media/root
  # ...and all relevant partitions (/usr, /var, ...) respectively
  2. mount --bind /dev /media/root/dev
  # since dpkg was complaining about missing debian-exim group, i had to  
get rid of statoverride:
  3. chroot /media/root
  4. dpkg-statoverride --remove /etc/exim4/passwd.client
  # later i must not forget to restore /var/lib/dpkg/statoverride from  
statoverride-old
  5. exit && cd
  6. wget  
http://ftp.cz.debian.org/debian/pool/main/e/eglibc/libc-bin_2.10.2-6_amd64.deb
  7. wget  
http://ftp.cz.debian.org/debian/pool/main/e/eglibc/libc6_2.10.2-6_amd64.deb
  8. dpkg --root=/media/root -i libc-bin_2.10.2-6_amd64.deb
  9. dpkg --root=/media/root -i libc6_2.10.2-6_amd64.deb
10. reboot

after reboot and restoration of statoverride, i can continue with apt-get  
upgrade and apt-get dist-upgrade; dpkg seems to work.

thanks again to you all!
