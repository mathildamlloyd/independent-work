=2e..and i hate websites using a 200 kbyte javascript,  sucking  500 mbyte
of memory and  consuming  100%  cpu  resources  to  implement  the  same
functionality as the adobe flash-pluging.

yes, i know a bunch of websites claiming there are  flash-free...  using
javascript for this purpose is the same crap as using flash.

thanks, greetings and nice day/evening
