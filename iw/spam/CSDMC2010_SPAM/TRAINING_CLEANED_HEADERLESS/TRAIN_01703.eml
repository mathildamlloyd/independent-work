this is my first time running razor, heard a lot of good things about it so
i thought i'd give it a shot.  i also run spamassassin so i'd like to
integrate the two.

i'm not sure if this problem is with spamassassin or razor, so i though i'd
shoot the message here first

with a freshly installed spamassassin 2.41 and razor 2.14 i'm seeing these
messages spit out from spamd:

razor2 check skipped: no such file or directory can't call method "log" on
unblessed reference at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/razor2/client/agent.pm
line 211,  line 75.

any ideas?  razor seems to run correctly over the command line.

thanks,
-dave
