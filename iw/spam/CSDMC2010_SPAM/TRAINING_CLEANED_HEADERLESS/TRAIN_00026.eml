dear reader,
hard-drive-based mp3 players, which allow you to store massive 
amounts of mp3s and other files on a portable device, have been 
around for a few years. but recently, three new players have 
taken the concept to a new high with impressive advancements 
in design, functionality, and interface. each has its unique 
strong points, but they're all groundbreaking in their own way.
