in recent java versions, there is a regression that prevents java web =
start applications from launching if there is no internet connection, =
even if they have  attribute.  launching without an =
internet connection causes the application to "hang".  this is a serious =
problem for us, since many of our users move between having an internet =
connection and not having an internet connection - we have lots of =
unhappy customers.

i believe that at least part of the problem is this oracle bug: =
 which =
claims will be fixed in 1.6.0_20.  (there also seem to be other bugs =
because launching without an internet connection still takes way too =
long even with the developer preview of 1.6.0_20 on windows7 - but at =
least it does launch.)

has anyone figured out a workaround for this problem?  any suggestions?

thanks, nick=
