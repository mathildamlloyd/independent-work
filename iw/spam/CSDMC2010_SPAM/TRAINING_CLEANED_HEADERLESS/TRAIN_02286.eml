debian users deserve quality packaging of upstream software, good integrati=

eat their kittens (yet data loss bugs happen). but whether upstream softwar=

kindly and wait till somebody else is motivated enough to do it.

move on. kdepim 4.3 is gone. given that kde sc 4.5 might release with kdepi=

from 4.4 anyway extending kdepim 4.4 codebase lifetime to 1 year, beating d=

horse (4.3) makes absolutely no sense. i recommend you to face reality here.

don't you see that you always put yourself in the front in your rationales?=
