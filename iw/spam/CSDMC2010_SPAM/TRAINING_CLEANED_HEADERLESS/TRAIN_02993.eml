i found the new icons don't have enough contrast to be easily
distinguishable so i changed the icons theme. unfortunately, some apps
still use the new ones; i'm guessing this may be due to gnome icon
symlinks named gtk-*.

once gnome 2.30 is fully in squeeze, i'm hoping to find some time to
discover what hacks are required to get legible icons again.
