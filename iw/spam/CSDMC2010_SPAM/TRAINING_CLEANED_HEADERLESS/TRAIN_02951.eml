for ip addresses there are 10.x.x.x , 192.168.x.x ip address that can
be used for private networks. is there something similar for mac
address of network cards that can be safely used with virtual
emulators and to be sure not to collide with any real network card
(current or future)?

currently i am using mac address
52:54:00:12:34:x
i guess i got it form some example for qemu usage or similar.
