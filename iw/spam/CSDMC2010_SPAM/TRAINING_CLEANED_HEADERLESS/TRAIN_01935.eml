when lenny was released, kde4 was just plain broken. since then, it 
has matured such that other distributions which have released with 
it.

i do not believe the decision to stay with kde3 in lenny was anything 
other than the simple pragmatic fact that lenny was being released at 
that time.

as much as i prefer kde3, i agree that there is nothing else the 
debian developers can do, since to take up kde3 would require 
effectively duplicating the entire kde development team.

the dropping of kde3 is a simple fact of life because it is no longer 
maintained upstream. i hope the pain will be worth it in the long 
run.

what i do not appreciate is that the attitude has been not "we have to 
do this", but "we're doing it, must suck to be you."
