note that many debian kde 3.5 installations include both qt3 and qt4,
e.g. to support kdebluetooth or lsb-desktop.

if you upgrade your ram from 1gb to 2gb, kde 4 feels about as fast
as kde 3.5, except kde 4 startup and kmail startup are still slower.

one reason for needing additional ram seems to be memory leaks,
although whether in qt4 or kde itself i don't know.
