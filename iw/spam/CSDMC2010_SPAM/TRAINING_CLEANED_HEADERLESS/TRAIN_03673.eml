i am wondering whether there's a way that i can use sitescooper and/or plucker
or some other free utility to convert word documents into something a bit
more palmos friendly?

i don't have a windows machine, so it becomes problematic to convert them;
i know that if this were not the case, in word i could save them as some
other more friendly format.

even if explicitly stated to the contrary, nothing in this posting should
