this is so true.
when i looked at establishing appleusers.org, as a central location of  
resources for australian user groups, i thought long and hard about  
the name i was going to call the group... and i deliberately steered  
clear of using mac or macintosh in the name... as i was aware that  
apple provides more than that product.

also apple themselves have never referred to user groups as macintosh  
user groups... the official logo they provide actually says apple user  
group

mind you mug sounds better as an acronym then aug does :)

apple has saved itself... and as much as i believe user groups did a  
far better job of keeping the apple flag visible back in the '90's  
then apple itself did, that is no longer the case in the 21st century

i agree that user groups are now basically fan clubs... or social  
groups that are bought together through a common interest of the  
devices and software that one company produces.

but i disagree that a user group can't be a "for profit" enterprize...  
as there are groups out there that are exactly that - look at some of  
the final cut pro groups as a perfect example that works extremely  
well under a "for profit" arrangement.

as others have mentioned, could you have chosen a better analogy than  
hannah montana :)
but the point you are making is quite correct.

i have friends who are involved with local historical societies, model  
train (and even real ones) appreciation societies, and even reptile  
keepers who get together to discuss raising of snakes, lizards etc...  
they don't expect that one single company owes them anything to help  
them exist or to function.  apple user groups should look at how some  
other 'social', 'hobby' and 'fan' clubs work.

every group that i have seen take that attitude isn't around anymore,  
or are quite visibly killing themselves right now

whilst i strongly advise all user groups that they need to evolve,  
they don't need to be reactionary with changes. evolution is a gradual  
change.

and whilst every group needs new members to survive, let alone expand,  
we have to remember that marketing 101 theorem that it is often easier  
to retain an existing customer then it is to get a new one.

so don't suddenly alienate your existing membership, but rather help  
lead them

apple's own 'think different' marketing strategy is still in place at  
apple today, even if you don't hear it been said... there is no other  
way they could have produced the iphone and ipad without embracing  
this philosophy.

user groups need to do the same

there are still places for newsletters and discs of the month, even in  
the 21st century... but again they need to be thought about  
differently... and form part of an overall strategy of attracting the  
same sort of customers that apple themselves now target.

then again, apple itself isn't exactly democratic in the way it  
appoints its' own board. the board itself effectively nominates itself  
and then shareholders ratify those nominations.... usually for the  
board as a block and not for individual nominees.

and shareholders certainly don't get a say in the day to day  
management of the company nor the projects that apple work on and  
eventually bring to market or even kill off before they get to market!
