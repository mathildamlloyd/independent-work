hello all,
i'm trying to get wins name resolution across subnets working and reckon the
first step is to be 
able to do a nmblookup without using the -b (broadcast address flag). does
anyone know how 
samba can be configured to do broadcasts to subnets other than just the
local subnet. 
i don't think this has anything to do with the remote announce parameter.

thanks
bryan
