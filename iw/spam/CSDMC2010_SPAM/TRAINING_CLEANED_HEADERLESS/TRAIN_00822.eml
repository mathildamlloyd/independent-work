hi all.

i=b4m working in a project that we would like to install in a =
touch-screen compact computer. my intention is to use debian as the os, =
and i'm searching for that kind of hardware with support for =
debian/linux. most of them support windows but it=b4s not clear if =
debian will work as well. i've found some support for touch screens =
(some models), but not clear for integrated/compact systems. someone =
knows where to look for?, or has some experience?, some url?

thanks in advance,
