this is my preferred mdadm 4 drive setup for a light office server or home
media/vanity server.  some minor setup details are omitted from the diagram
to keep it simple, such as the fact that /boot is a mirrored 100mb partition
set and that there are two non mirrored 1gb swap partitions.  / and /var are
mirrored partitions in the remaining first 30gb.  these sizes are arbitrary,
and can be seasoned to taste.  i find these sizes work fairly well for a non
gui debian server.

md raid, 4 x 500gb 7.2k rpm sataii drives:

/    \ /    \
 --------  3  --------    --------  3  --------
| /boot  | 0 | /boot  |  | swap1  | 0 | swap2  |
| /      | g | /      |  | /var   | g | /var   |
|--------|   |--------|  |--------|   |--------|
| /home  |   | /home  |  | /home  |   | /home  |

         -------------------------------
     raid 10
   940 gb net

for approximately the same $$ outlay one could simply mirror two 1tb 7.2k
rpm drives and have the same usable space and a little less power draw.  the
4 drive raid 10 setup will yield better read and write performance due to
the striping, especially under a multiuser workload, and especially for imap
serving of large mailboxen.  for a small/medium office server running say
postfix/dovecot/samba/lighty+roundcube webmail, a small intranet etc, the 4
drive setup would yield significantly better performance than the higher
capacity 2 drive setup.  using newegg's prices, each solution will run a
little below or above $200.

this 4 drive raid 10 makes for a nice little inexpensive and speedy setup.
1tb of user space may not seem like much given the capacity of today's
drives, but most small/medium offices won't come close to using that much
space for a number of years, assuming you have sane email attachment policies.
