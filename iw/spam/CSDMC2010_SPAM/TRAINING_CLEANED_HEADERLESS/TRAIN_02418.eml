not so odd, this issue came up several weeks ago (with no real
resolution).

everything else :)  i can't even mark text in an exmh message window
and then paste it into a terminal window, the cut buffer seems to be
completely empty (and its previous contents are no longer there
either).

  btw: talking of spring downunder... i'm in queensland.  it almost
  feels like early summer already (winters here are dry and warm,
  much better than cold wet miserable melbourne :-)  despite some
  recent rain (first in months), we are already into a drought, with
  an el-nino on the way it is only going to get worse...  (the last
  one in the 90s caused one of the worst droughts ever seen here in
  aussie).

cheers
