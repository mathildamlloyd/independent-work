actually, i personally have not. however, this was actually the design
goal of qt4 and many users have tested and reported lower memory usage
in kde 4 compared to kde 3. i don't know about cpu, though.

also, the last time i ran kde 3.5.10 it felt was noticeably lagging
compared to my then-current kde 4.3 setup on the same hardware. note
that the kde 4.3 even had quite a few other apps installed, and the
kde 3.5.10 was a new install that i did to triage a possible
regression.

like i said, though, if you need qt3 libraries in addition to qt4 (for
quanta, for instance) then you will be using the memory of _both_,
naturally, and that is a lot!
