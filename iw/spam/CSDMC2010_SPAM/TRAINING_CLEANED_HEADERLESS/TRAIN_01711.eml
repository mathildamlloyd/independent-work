if i were to install a bare-bones squeeze system, then add lenny
repositories and declare lenny to be the default-release in apt.conf,
can i expect to have many problems installing a full desktop environment
from the lenny repos?  (gnome, lxde, or fluxbox, most likely).

reason:

i use a debian-live usb and i like to run lenny because of the
infrequent updates.  but one of my laptops requires the squeeze kernel
in order for wifi to work.  i've been told by the debian-live developer
that i cannot install alternate kernels on my live system (otherwise i'd
be able to use a kernel from backports.org).
