mike,

thanks for explaining this, and clarifying the situation.

i can report that i indeed did not have sufficient privileges. so i
logged in as somebody who does, and was able to change the preference,
and everything* now works as advertised.

*except for two-finger scrolling in 1.6.0_20 own-process applets whose
browser window is displayed on my secondary display! please see bug id
8017275.

thanks for your help,

rob
