this is exactly the reason i chose debian 10 years ago when i was looking
for my first linux distro.  i told a friend i wanted a server distro that
wasn't going to spoon feed me, but make me learn something about linux.

casey, a seasoned debian sysadmin, recommended i download the debian net
install floppies and do my first install from the mirrors, only a compact
base install, and to install everything else i needed by hand with apt.
that was potato with a 2.2 kernel.

i only use linux for non-gui servers.  i don't use desktop linux.  all my
admin'ing requires knuckle busting. ;)  and i like it that way.
