if xfsprogs is installed, then i think fsck will do it, just first run 
something like:

tune2fs -c912 /dev/sda3

and reboot, where c is the capital 'c', 912 is some number larger than 
the current maximum mount count (before automatically fsck'ing) and 
substitute your actual device path for the /dev/sda3 i used as an 
example.

i think xfsprogs has some other tools as well.

oh wait, i reread your question.


if the machine is in working order, you can just do:

#apt-get install xfsprogs

if not, then a live cd will be needed, something like knoppix, be sure 
it has xfs support.  just boot the live cd or dvd, and bob's your uncle.

i'm unsure, does the debian squeeze installer fully support xfs?
