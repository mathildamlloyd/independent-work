yes

is this realistic description?  it is usually lazy mantainer or dead
upstream which delay such fixes.  upstream fix should likely be around
if someone fixed that for stable.

i see... i now think placing pointer to faq should be good idea to
explain all these issues.

i need to think think about the context of these.  this was in
section describing "archive".  (i have other place where i say "for your
**production server**, the `stable` suite with the security updates is
recommended.")  

so i am updating as:

tip: if "`sid`" is used in the above example instead of
"`@-@codename-stable@-@`", the "`deb: http://security.debian.org/ ...`"
line for security updates in the "`/etc/apt/sources.list`" is not
required.   this is because there is no security update archive for
"`sid`" (`unstable`).

note: the security bugs for the `stable` archive are fixed by the debian
security team.  this activity has been quite rigorous and reliable.
those for the `testing` archive may be fixed by the debian testing
security team.  for several reasons, this activity is not as rigorous as
that for `stable` and you may need to wait for the migration of fixed
`unstable` packages.  those for the `unstable` archive are fixed by the
individual maintainer.  actively maintained `unstable` packages are
usually in a fairly good shape by leveraging latest upstream security
fixes. see http://www.debian.org/security/faq[debian security faq]
for how debian handles security bugs.
