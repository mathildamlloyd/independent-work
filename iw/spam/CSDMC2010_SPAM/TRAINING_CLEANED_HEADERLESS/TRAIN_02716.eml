 yes. especially in the languages he was talking about - c, pascal and
assembler. goto's can be used well; there are a few used in the kernel
code to improve efficency. they are almost required in some languages
(like c) where 'break' or 'continue' can't be told how many loops/switches
to break out of.

 but, in general, goto's make a mess of code.

 recursion is only truely useful if you have an infinite stack. people
that think they have an infinite stack shouldn't be let near a compiler.

 i don't care, to be honest.
