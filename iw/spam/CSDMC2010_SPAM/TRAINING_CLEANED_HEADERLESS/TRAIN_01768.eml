_jeffrey zeldman_: os x blues update[1]. 

    a couple of intellectuals have pointed out parallels between the rigidity 
    of os x, which derives its power from unix and xml, and the rules of 
    standards-based web development, which also compels you to do things the 
    right way instead of using five different non-standard hacks. the parallel 
    is not without merit. building web pages the right way is hard at first, 
    but once you get it, you never want to go back. regardless, we miss os 9's 
    flexibility and ease of use, and a metric ton of logic doesn't offset that 
    feeling of loss.
