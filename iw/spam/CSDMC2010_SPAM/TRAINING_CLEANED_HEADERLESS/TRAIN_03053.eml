        the readme is out of date. i'll try and remember to fix this
 (feel free to file a bug report to remind me). 

        i am not sure why the revision flag was not taking effect (i
 have not had time to look into the mails yet), but the +drm3 is coming
 from the kernel code (something is setting .localversions or the ilk).
