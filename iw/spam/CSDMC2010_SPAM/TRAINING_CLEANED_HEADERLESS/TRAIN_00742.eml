slashdot's reporting that according to the current ish of popular science, an 
easter egg has been discovered in the transmission control software for the bmw 
m3: 

    ...the proper combination of commands to the electronically controlled 
    manual transmission will cause the car to rev up to 4000rpm and drop the 
    clutch... 

are we sure that this is a feature and not a bug? link[1] discuss[2]
