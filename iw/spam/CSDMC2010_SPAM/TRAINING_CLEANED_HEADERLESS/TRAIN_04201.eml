hi!

i=92m having strange display problems with several web browsers. certain
layout parts (as borders or backgrounds) aren=92t at the appropriate
place; and they=92re moving if i hover them. i encountered this problem
with the following browsers:

 - iceweasel from lenny-backports
 - firefox downloaded directly from mozilla
 - epiphany from lenny-backports

this behaviour already occured before installing firefox; and it=92s not
caused by any plug-ins or add-ons as epiphany (which i didn=92t customize=
)
behaves the same (wrong) way.

to illustrate the problem, i made a screenshot of e. g. german bash
blog: web page [1], screenshot [2]. on other pages, there are similar
errors.

it would be great if anyone could tell me how to fix this or where to
ask for further help.

best regards,
robin
