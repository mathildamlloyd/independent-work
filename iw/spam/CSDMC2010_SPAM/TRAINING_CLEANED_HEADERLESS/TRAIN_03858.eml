i see nothing about the failure. all seems to go fine, postfix 
establishes a connection with remote server and silently fails :-/

put postfix into a more verbose logging. in "main.cf":

***
debug_peer_level = 2
debug_peer_list = newserver
***

reload postfix and try again.

p.s. 1 - check the more basic here: saslauth mechanisms being used for 
authenticating and of course, a correct password in "/etc/postfix/
sasl_passwd" o:-)

p.s. 2 - remember that "535 5.7.3 authentication unsuccessful" is a 
message coming from exchange server -not postfix- so it would be great if 
you could review the logs from the ms server side.
