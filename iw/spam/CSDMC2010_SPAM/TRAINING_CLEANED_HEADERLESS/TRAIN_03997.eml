agreed.

but i have always thought that the value 5 was not the best value.  it
should have been 0.  i understand that initially only spammy scores
were included.  but i believe the algorithm should be purely
symmetrical and non-spammy negative values should also have been
balancing out the spammy positive values, like they do in sa today.
then anything that was positive would be spam and anything negative
would be non-spam.  (and i guess exactly zero is grey. :-) today's
choice of 5 just adds an offset.  which i think cause people to assume
things work differently than they do.
