hahaha...  who want to use this kde crap?

on my test workstation i had to install over 400 mbyte of kde crap  even
if i do not use kde...  kde and gnome are the  most  unreliable  desktop
envirement ever coded.

i can not even run some progams on my arm  workstation which is based on
the "marvel armada 300" with 2 ghz and 1 gbyte of memory du to a  memory
problem with kde.

thanks, greetings and nice day/evening
