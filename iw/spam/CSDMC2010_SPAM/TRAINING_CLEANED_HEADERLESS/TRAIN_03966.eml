since the amphetadesk source code is so easily modifiable on any platform, i've 
been seeing some interesting hacks and modifications lately. the most powerful 
of them is l.m. orchard's newest template[1], which provides an insane amount 
of new features, including hiding old items, click counting, and an outline 
based format. more than likely, a revised version of his hack will appear as a 
selectable template in the next version (amphetadesk v0.94). 

also of interest is brian cantoni's ftpstore[2]: _"ftpstore is a slight 
addition to the amphetadesk news aggregator. the modified code will retrieve 
the personal channel list from an ftp location during startup and store it back 
to the same location during shutdown. this provides a simple method to keep 
your saved channels in a network location. if you use amphetadesk at home and 
at work, for example, this feature will let you keep your list of channels in 
sync."_ it's a major improvement for amphetadesk users with multiple machines.
