please, let me know what kde 4 is missing for you. kde 4.4 has only a
handful of regressions from kde 3.5.10, and they are not dealbreakers.
some of those are addressed in kde 4.5.

the "kde 4 sux" time has passed. if you still have problems with kde
4, then please let me know what they are so that they can be fixed.

thanks!
