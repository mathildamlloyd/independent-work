hi,

i am running up-to-date squeeze on a dell latitude d420. i have a
trivial problem, but such things bother me :-)

the hotkeys for volume and brightness adjustment work out of the box in a
gnome session. however, when i adjust the volume using the hotkeys, i see
a nice translucent on-screen display of the volume level. this is not
the case for brightness control.

interestingly, i briefly installed kde a couple of days ago. i then
found that, *during a gnome session*, the brightness osd did appear. it
vanished again after i removed kde.

so, the kde installation seemed to pull in some package which is
responsible for the brightness osd. any idea which of the dozens of
packages it might be?
