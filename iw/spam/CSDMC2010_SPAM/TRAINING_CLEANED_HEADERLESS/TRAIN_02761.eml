i've seen this recently in #debian and we were able to "fix" this with
the following in /etc/x11/xorg.conf

section "device"
        identifier "r128"
        driver "r128"
        option "noaccel"
endsection

the related bug report is [1] and this will disable acceleration for
your card, so it is not really a good fix. you might also want to make
sure that you have the firmware package(s) installed.

good luck
