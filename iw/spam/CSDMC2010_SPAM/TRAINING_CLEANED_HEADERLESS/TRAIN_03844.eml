hello,

i have a web-service that produces static images from various sources =
using quartz.

recently i wanted to add the capability of adding qtmovie screenshots =
there, but i'm having some issues.

when the service is run by a user which currently has a graphical login, =
it works fine - i can load a qtmovie, and grab a frame from a specific =
time to be used in the image export.


however, in the production environment, the app is run by a user which =
is not logged in. everything else (quartz) works fine, but qtmovie =
loading bails out with this:

=
/sourcecache/qtothercomponents/quicktime-1674/midvale/ava_vp3_qt/component=
/ava_hdutilitieshw.c: cggetonlinedisplaylist failed with code 1011=20
=
/sourcecache/qtothercomponents/quicktime-1674/midvale/ava_vp3_qt/component=
/ava_hdutilitieshw.c: cggetonlinedisplaylist failed with code 1011=20
_registerapplication(), failed to establish the default connection to =
the windowserver, _cgsdefaultconnection() is null
=
/sourcecache/qtothercomponents/quicktime-1674/midvale/ava_vp3_qt/component=
/ava_hdutilitieshw.c: cggetonlinedisplaylist failed with code 1011=20

is there a way to work around this? i only want to get the poster image =
from that movie, nothing else. i can detect in my code when i'm not =
connected to the windowserver with cggetonlinedisplaylist, so i can =
switch to a different code path if required.

regards,
