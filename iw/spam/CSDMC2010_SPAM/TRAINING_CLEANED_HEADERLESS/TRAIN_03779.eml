san francisco, california (cnn) -- the u.s.
justice department filed an appeal monday to
overturn a federal judge's ruling that
upheld oregon's doctor-assisted suicide law.

a spokesman for oregon attorney general
hardy myers said the state views the appeal
as "same story, different day."

oregon voters approved doctor-assisted
suicide twice, in ballot initiatives in 1994
and 1997. but in november, u.s. attorney
general john ashcroft warned oregon doctors
they would be prosecuted under federal law
if they prescribed lethal doses of drugs for
dying patients.
