"rssflowersalignright"i've gotten to know phil ringalda over the last few weeks 
in all the discussions about rss 2.0, and i like him, and would like to work 
with him in the future. i don't say that lightly. this evening he posted a note
[1] on his weblog that he was giving up trying to get rdf to make sense inside 
rss. as i read his essay i could feel two-plus years of exhaustion overwhelm 
me. i found myself writing a comment after his essay saying, among other things 
"rss is not a brilliant format. it is a compromise. it is for syndicating news 
feeds. that's all it is for, for the 18,000th time." it's time for rdf to pack 
its bags and leave. rss deserves some dignity, as does rdf. emphatically, once 
and for all, they are not the same thing. peace be with you rdf. leave rss 
alone. thank you.
