the out-of-process plugin2 should work fine on 32-bit only macs.

switching between the in and out-of-process plugins is a simple matter =
of adding or removing a symlink to the in-process plugin to =
/library/internet plug-ins. you should only see grey radio buttons in =
java preferences if you don't have write permissions in that directory. =
it's possible that if you have other java plugins present in your =
~/library/internet plug-ins folder, that could be confusing the =
logic...maybe.

can you "ls -al@e /library/internet\ plug-ins" and "ls -al@e =
~/library/internet\ plug-ins" to see what plugins are present, and if =
there are any funny acls or extended attributes?

best of luck,
