hi, richard,

i am running windows xp 32 bit, windows xp pro 64 bit, and, at the
moment, ubuntu 10.04 in virtual box. every "just works", including the
web, usb attachments, etc.. i recommend it.

this is the non-free sun version, though, as i didn't have a lot of
luck (it was some time ago) with the packaged version.

ymmv

hth

terence
