yup. i've blocked telnet and some irrelevant icmp for a long time. it =
dawned on me the other day that i couldn't think of any reason not to =
just drop all tcp and udp traffic to the router's outside ip.

no routing protocols on the outside interface. the vpns are handled by a =
host in the dmz. to this router, the vpn traffic looks like just more =
udp between public ips.

there's no port forwarding, and nat all happens inside, on the firewall =
that connects the outside, the dmz, and the lan. this router sees only =
my routable address space (and its ip on the 1918 net between it and the =
firewall).
