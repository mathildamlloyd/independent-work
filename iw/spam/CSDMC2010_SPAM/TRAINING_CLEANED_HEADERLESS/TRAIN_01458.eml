i too have an  abit nf7 (tho' not an -s).  the memory was installed by the=
=20
shop where i bought the components of my computer.  (i was intending to bui=
ld=20
it myself and he didn't trust me with the cpu or memory!!)  he told me taht=
 i=20
had dual channel memory installed, and would need to replace both 256 mb=20
sticks if i increased the memory capacity.

i have never seen any sign of dual channel operation. (tho' i didn't know w=
hat=20
to look for, which hardly helped!)

dmidecode gives:

memory device
       [snip]
        size: 256 mb
        form factor: dimm
        set: none
        locator: a0
        bank locator: bank0/1
        [snip]

memory device
        [snip]
        size: no module installed
        form factor: dimm
        set: none
        locator: a1
        bank locator: bank2/3
        [snip]

memory device
        [snip]
        size: 256 mb
        form factor: dimm
        set: none
        locator: a2
        bank locator: bank4/5
       =20
would i be correct in taking this to mean  that the memory modules appear t=
o=20
be incorrectly installed, and that i could improve my memory performance by=
=20
moving one of the modules that dual channel functions?  and also, if that=20
does not give me enough improvement (which it almost certainly won't), i=20
could add another module in the third channel, which would not necessarily=
=20
need to be the same size as the other two?
