if it weren't for the live migration requirement, i read this to say that
google would be using xfs due to its superior performance:

"in a mailing list post, google engineer michael rubin provided more insight
into the decision-making process that led the company to adopt ext4. the
filesystem offered significant performance advantages over ext2 _and nearly
rivaled the high-performance xfs filesystem_ during the company's tests.
ext4 was ultimately chosen over xfs because it would allow google to do a
live in-place upgrade of its existing ext2 filesystems."
