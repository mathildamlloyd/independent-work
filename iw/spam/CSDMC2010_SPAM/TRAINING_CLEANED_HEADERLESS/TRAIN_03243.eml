motorola sees profit rebound 
chicago - wireless technology giant motorola inc. on wednesday said it expects to bounce back to a net profit in the third and fourth quarters helped by aggressive cost cutting.

motorola, a day after posting the largest quarterly loss in its history, said it expects to achieve earnings of about 2 cents a share in the third quarter and 10 cents in the fourth quarter. the estimated earnings for the second half of the year includes charges of about $215 million related to previously announced restructuring actions.

the world's second largest mobile phone maker has slashed its work force by more than a third from its peak of 150,000 in august 2000. it said last month it would cut another 7,000 jobs, bringing employment to 93,000 by mid-2003.
