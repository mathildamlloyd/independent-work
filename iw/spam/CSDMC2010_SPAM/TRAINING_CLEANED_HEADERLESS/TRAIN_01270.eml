the president's niece will no longer have to forge prescriptions for valium. 
all she'll have to do is participate in an unruly public demonstration to get a 
free dose. unfortunately for her, the government has no plans to shoot rocks of 
cocaine at demonstrators, so she'll still have to depend on her drug dealer for 
that.

    people without killing them during riots or other crowd control situations 
    where lethal weapons are inappropriate.
