ive bee using chrome dev channel version for several months now.  i like the 
fact that each tab has its on process.  if one crashed it does not take the 
whole browser with it.  i watch a lot of flash videos on hulu, etc and when 
flash crashes or i loose audio from flash all i have to do is terminate the 
flash process from chrome's own task manager and restart the video.  i use 2 
monitors and when i watch videos on one screen i some time browse the web in 
another chrome window on the second monitor.  i may have many tabs open which i 
don't want to close just to restart flash when it fails like i would in 
firefox.  i do use adblock for chrome but i have not seen it do mush for 
blocking adds.
