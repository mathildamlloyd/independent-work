i will not be reading my mail for a while -- in fact, i will be reading my mail
very intermittently until june, as i'm travelling around the world.
your mail regarding "immediately attract women          .                pvwpj" will be read at that point.

if you're writing about something netnote-related, please contact nicola
mcdonnell .  

spamassassin-related contact should be directed to the spamassassin-talk
mailing list , or to craig hughes
.

sitescooper-related mail should go to .
webmake-related stuff goes to, you guessed it,  ;)

i will (probably) read your mail eventually... but it will take a while.
see you in june!
