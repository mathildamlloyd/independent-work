you seem to have configuration files of older texlive packages on your
system (marked with "rc" in your dpkg output).

so try to get rid of them and, may be, update your
texlive-installation'. with aptitude the commands are

aptitude purge ~c            # this removes all old configuration files

aptitude update
aptitude install ~utexlive   # update of all texlive packages
