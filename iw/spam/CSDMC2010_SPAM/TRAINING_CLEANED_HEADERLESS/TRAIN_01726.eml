note how at the bottom or this example bar/shoe still points to 
../snuffle/shoe/.  when you try to "cp -axv / /some/new/root" the 
same thing will happen.   in /usr/bin all the symlinks to 
/etc/alternatives will still point to the *current* 
/etc/alternatives not to /some/new/root/etc/alternatives.
