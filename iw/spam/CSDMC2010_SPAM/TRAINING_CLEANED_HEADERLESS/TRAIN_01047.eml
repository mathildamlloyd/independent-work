in short yes. the more logic involved the longer
the cpu is executing it. i.e. there is more logic
executed (including nic logic) when going down
to the metal than when using lo. so how much
logic is involved for each type of ipc (why
are you limiting yourself to sockets? there are
mutexes, shared mem, files, messages...). anyway the
best ipc method to choose is dictated by the data
you want to communicate between the processes,
as the various ipc mechanisms are tuned for
various data types.

ibm are running a series comparing doze and linux ipc mechanisms.
the socket (which references the others at the bottom) is here:

the following in google gave useful info also:
"linux ipc mechanisms compared"
