i don't think there's much more room for lowering fps left which the ga can 
achieve.  remember, also, that the awl will reduce fps, but its effects aren't 
factored in to the ga scores.

the work currently being done on the ga, and comparing different methods of 
doing the score-setting, is very worthwhile, and extremely useful; however, we 
really ought to get a release out, since 2.31 is getting decreasingly useful as 
time goes on.

the fp/fn rate of 2.40 with pretty well *any* score-setting mechanism will be 
better than 2.31 -- we can continue with adjusting how the scores are set on the 
2.41 or 2.50 branches.

you could just allow low and high to be evolved by the ga (within ranges); i'd 
be enormously surprised if it didn't end up with low=-12 and high=+6, since 
that'd give the ga the broadest lattitude in setting individual scores.  the 
issue with fixing low and high is not one of optimization, but rather one of 
human-based concern that individual scores larger than about +4 are dangerous 
and liable to generate fps, and individual scores less than -8 are dangerous and 
liable to be forged to generate fns.

dq> maybe even add a nybias loop.

adding an nybias loop is not worthwhile -- changing nybias scores will just 
alter the evaluation function's idea of what the fp:fn ratio should be.

i've been searching for that, but i guess the details of where the channel was 
got lost in the shuffle.
