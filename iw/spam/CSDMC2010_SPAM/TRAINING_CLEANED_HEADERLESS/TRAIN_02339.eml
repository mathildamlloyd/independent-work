you should run "aptitude unmarkauto grub-legacy" and remove the
transitional grub package.  unfortunately the case where a transitional
package a pulls in another package b is not handled well by the package
managers, i always end up "aptitude unmarkauto b; aptitude markauto a"
to tell apt that i want to keep the new package and that it can remove
the transitional one as soon as nothing depends on it anymore.

because it decides that the grub-legacy package is unused and can be
removed despite the pin.  whether this is the right thing is debatable;
i'm sure you find some bug reports about that if you dig into the long
list of aptitude bugs.
