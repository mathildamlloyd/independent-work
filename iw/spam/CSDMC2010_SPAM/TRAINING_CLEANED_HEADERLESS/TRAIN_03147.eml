hello,

i'm curious as to the different ways one can create a usb install stick, for
the purpose of installing debian.

it is possible to do it by
a) acquiring (where?) a boot.img.gz file, and then doing "zcat boot.img.gz >
/dev/sdc". then load a netboot iso to the disc.
b) making a fat/fat32 partition on the stick, and then doing "syslinux
/dev/sdxx", copying vmlinuz and initrd.gz to the stick
c) using unetbootin with an .iso file

i like the way unetbootin allows one to use a larger .iso (dvd, or full cd
iso). the downside of a) and b) is that you can only use the smaller netboot
.isos, and if i wanted to load a few more files onto the disc for use i
wouldn't have the room to do so.

does anyone know another method? i'm particularly interested in knowing the
way to do what unetbootin does manually, so that i could load a cd/dvd iso
onto the stick after making it boot-able.

regards,
james
