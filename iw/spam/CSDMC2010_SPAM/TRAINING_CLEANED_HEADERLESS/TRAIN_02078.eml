of course, dear.  especially without zazen training.  veritably

it's a myth that we don't use parts of our brain.  we use it all,
always.  it's just that our culturally-induced focal-point causes most
of us to most of the time ignore and waste 99.999% of it.  "lucid" is
a measure of notch-filter bandwidth; all stations are broadcasting,
but we only /choose/ easy rock 105.

for example, don't look now but your shoes are full of feet.

the sensation of toes the above statement evokes is not a "turning on"
of circuits, it is a "tuning in".  the next step, of course, is to
"drop out" :)

to paraphrase an old saw: life is wasted on the living.
