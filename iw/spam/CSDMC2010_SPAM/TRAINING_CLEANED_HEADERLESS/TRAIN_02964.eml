as others have mentioned, rgw command-line parameter $1 probably has a
'/' in it.

a simple workaround is to use a different character as the separator.
that is: *if* you can assume that variable will not contain the
character '|', you can use:

  sed -e "s|placeholder1|$1|' -e "s|placeholder2|$2|" < input > output

you can use some other characters there as well. see sed(1).
