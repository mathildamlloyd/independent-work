i was a respondent who questioned the netbook route, but i see now that 
there may be good reasons to prefer one.

however, most netbooks are deliberately crippled, such as allowing only 
1 or 2 gb of memory when there is no technical reason why 4 gb shouldn't 
work.  it is a matter of segmenting a market, and manufacturers want 
netbooks to have specific capabilities for marketing reasons, not 
technical ones.

i wanted to suggest that you choose a machine based on your needs, and i 
wanted you to question your initial assumptions.

however, i see you have done some thinking about it, and future-proofing 
*does* seem like a good reason to get a dual-core, 64-bit machine.

with 64 bits, you will need more memory, so i suggest you look for a 
machine that can use 4 gb of memory.

i suggest also that you make sure that the machine you get can use 
solid-state storage devices.  in time, the advantages of ssds will make 
them compelling, though now they are too expensive.  that is, you will 
probably buy a machine with a standard notebook hd, but if you ever need 
to replace it, being able to replace it with an ssd gives you another 
option.  this also is in the area of future-proofing.


just a couple of suggestions.  i would like to hear more from other 
people.  (i am also contemplating a portable computer purchase.)
