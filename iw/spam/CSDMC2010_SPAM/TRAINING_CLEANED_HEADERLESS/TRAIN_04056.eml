i've written my apple push notification client code in java (on my =
server). i open an ssl socket to apple with a client-side cert, and push =
a stream of bytes.

if part of that stream is mal-formed, as i understand it, apple closes =
their end of the connection. also as i understand it, this is made =
evident to a c client because the number of bytes written to the socket =
is 0 (or less than was intended).

however, in java, i'm finding no evidence at all that apple has stopped =
accepting push notifications, except that i can see the last =
notification doesn't go through (i set up a test case with one good and =
one bad token. by changing the order, i can see it work or not work).

what do i need to do to detect this condition in java? i tried checking =
that the connection is still open and not half-open after each token, =
but it always looks good.

tia,
rick
