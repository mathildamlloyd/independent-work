i installed xserver-xorg-core-nouveau (1:0.0.15+git20100329+7858345-3) of
squeze.  my video card is an inbuilt one.
00:0d.0 vga compatible controller: nvidia corporation c61 [geforce 7025 /
nforce 630a] (rev a2)
but after switching xorg.conf to use "nouveau", there was error saying that
no video device found.
finally i followed.
http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/installnouveau
compiled both drm and xf86-video-nouveau and replaced both libdrm and
/usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/nouveau_drv.so
now it is working fine.
