hi,

im comparison to another computer, working still with lenny, the
display of fonts in konsole is bad:-(
without antialiasing on squeeze (as in lenny) the fonts are angular,
with activated antialiasing the fonts are too spongy. so, where do i
have to search to resolve this problem? on my lenny-desktop font in
konsole without antialiasing looks perfect. in squeeze not:-(
ah: another one: in lenny the used font is "fixed [misc]" and it can
display an "". using "fixed [misc]" in squeeze cannot show me the ""
anymore:-(

any hints?


ciao, dirk
