before pressing "connect" be sure your calculator is setup as described 
here:

http://hptalx.sourceforge.net/manual.shtml#aen171

can you see the "awaiting server cmd." message in calculator's display?

port "100"? what kind of port nomenclature is that? :-? 

i would expect "/dev/ttyusb0" for an usb device or "/dev/ttys0" for the

i think the application is crashing because cannot establish a connection 
with the device.
