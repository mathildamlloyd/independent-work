in thomas' defense, i noticed the same thing and had much the same reaction.  

the squeeze kde 4.4 update this week pulled down network-manager as a dependency.  in my case i much prefer wicd to handle my wireless.  

the update had them both running simultaneously, which i didn't like at all.  i was plugged into my wired network, which wicd had set up as default, and network-manger connected to one of the wireless networks i had configured.  both interfaces up, even two default routes.  yuk.

i didn't like the fact that the kde update ignored my current install of wicd to install network-manager, and when i purged network-manager kde worked (and continues to work) just fine.

so the "dependency" on network-manager seems to be merely a preference of the kde team.  to me that means i should not have seen network-manager if i already had wicd installed.  this is very similar to the various packages that insist they need avahi-daemon to work, and yet purging avahi-daemon doesn't break anything not using mdns.

so while thomas could file a bug, i don't think it's not germane to complain about dds putting everything under the sun into a dependency list.  here's the place for the community to decide whether we really need to force an install of network-manager (or avahi) when they're not really needed, or decide that because some cases might require it everyone should have it.

anyway, just my 2c

james ------------------------------------ 

only time i have incurred this is when i have preferences set to
include "recommended" files as "dependencies" thereby passing control
of the upgrade to the system. not a good idea btw!! i use synaptic most
of the time & i suspect aptitude has a similar setting. command line
updates do not have this issue.:-)
