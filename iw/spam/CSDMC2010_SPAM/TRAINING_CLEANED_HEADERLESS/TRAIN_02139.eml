hi,

havn't tried this, but looks like what you want.  i use procmail to filter
different incomgin to/ccs to different folders then use folder hok, but
this looks closer to what you want.

**************************************************************************
some of the mailto links on our web site forward to me. when i reply to
someone who writes to one of these aliases, i prefer to keep the mail alias
as the from: address in my reply. for example, when someone sends email to
coolapps@linuxcare.com to suggest a program for me to review [pardon the
blatant plug...], it forwards to me. when i hit reply, the from: line in
the email will contain coolapps@linuxcare.com instead of my main address
bneely@linuxcare.com. my .muttrc file accomplishes this with two lines:

set alternates = "kbeditor@linuxcare.com|coolapps@linuxcare.com"
set reverse_name
