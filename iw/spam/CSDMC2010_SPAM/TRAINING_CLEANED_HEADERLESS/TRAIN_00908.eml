do you have a pointer to the discussion?

as far as the safety of your data is concerned, none of your emails are 
stored in mysql (yet). mail storage is still in the file system, akonadi 
is only used for contacts.

that said, i'd be much happier myself without having to run yet another 
database server on my machine. right now there are "global" instances of 
postgresql and mysql (personal and for work); on top of that, for each 
logged-in user, akonadi runs a private mysql server as well as a 
virtuoso server. incidentally, virtuoso is a sql database in its own 
right, persumably fully capable of completing supplanting mysql in this 
case.
