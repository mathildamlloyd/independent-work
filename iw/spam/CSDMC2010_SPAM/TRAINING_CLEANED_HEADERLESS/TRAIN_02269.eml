well you know what i mean.

i noticed 2 connections from my
(freshly installed rh7.3) machine to
port 80 of the following addresses.

216.145.20.5
216.254.17.87

both resolve to cytocin.hubbe.net
using ccom.net & speakeasy.net dns
servers respectively.

both connections lasted about 20
seconds and were about 2 minutes apart.
any ideas?

i didn't see what processes they came from,
but i'm keeping a close eye now.

thanks,
pdraig.

p.s. i'm can't subscribe to the list
at the moment for some reason? so please
reply directly.
