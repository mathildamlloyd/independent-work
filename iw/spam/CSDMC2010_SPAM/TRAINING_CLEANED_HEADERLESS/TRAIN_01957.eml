hi,
the problem here is that windows has problems in implementing
"propper" file locking symantics. on the side of acroread.exe, it
should not assume documents are static on disk. not sure if something
like file alteration monitor exists on windows. what is needed is a
cross-platform fam-like library. any suggestions?
