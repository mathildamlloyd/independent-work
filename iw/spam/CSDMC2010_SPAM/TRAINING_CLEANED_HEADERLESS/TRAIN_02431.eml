first of all, i am very new to linux but am well aware of the need to
learn.  after considerable googling with my issue, i gave up and thought i'd
try a mailing list instead :)

in attempting to install the cvm package (apt-get install cvm), i recieve a
warning indicating that the xdm service cannot be automatically
stopped/started and that i should do so manually.

i then use rcconf to remove the little dot-selector-thingy beside xdm,
which, as far as i understand, should stop the service immediately, but
errors ensue in the rest of the installation and when i continue the
installation again (apt-get -f install) i recieve the same warning that xdm
is running and needs to be stopped manually.  checking in rcconf, the
service is already unselected.  taking a hint from my background with ms
windows, i restarted the computer and tried the installation again; same
warning and rcconf still shows the service as unselected.

what am i not understanding here?  thanks in advance!
