o.k. here is what i was looking for:

"linux, freebsd, osx and other oss" all of them include their own 
licencing model, whatever it is (closed or open sourced), so i can use 
the software knowing beforehand what i can (or can't) do with it.

the licensing model of flash was (very) unclear for me, that is what i 
meant to say. and heck, it was recently "opened" (2008?) so it's a 
evolving license that could "dissolve" into something worse.

do not get me wrong, i'm only saying that if i were a developer, i would 
have many doubts in choosing a flash format for any of my works.
