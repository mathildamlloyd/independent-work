i don;t need to do that, my laptop autoamically picks the external monitor
if the lid is closed - on boot up

yep this doesn't work on mine, plus i want to do it from software. i would
like a xrandr for the console if such a thing exists

how can you use ctrl+alt+f1 to switch to virtual terminal number 1 if=
 the
lid is closed? =a0are you using an external keyboard as well as an external=

monitor? =a0you never mentioned that.yep external=
 keyboard - does that make a difference !=a0

i have an ibm thinkpad 600. =a0here's what i do:

(1) while the laptop is powered off, i connect the external monitor.
i do not connect an external keyboard.

(2) i power on the external monitor, then i power on the laptop.

(3) as soon as possible during the boot process, usually after "lilo&q;=
uot;
has been written to the screen but before the timeout occurs to
boot the default kernel (which for me is a four-second window),
i use fn+f7 on the internal keyboard to switch to the external monitor.=
i don;t need to do that, my laptop autoamically picks=
 the external monitor if the lid is closed - on boot up=a0


(4) by the time the kernel boots, the display is on the external
monitor for the text-mode portion of the boot.

(5) when gdm starts, the graphical console also displays on the
external monitor.

(6) when i use ctrl+alt+f1 on the *internal* keyboard, without
closing the lid, the display switches to virtual terminal 1 on
the external monitor.

(7) when i use alt+f7 to switch back to the graphical console,
the display stays on the external monitor.yep thi=
s doesn't work on mine, plus i want to do it from software. i would lik=
e a xrandr for the console if such a thing exists=a0

i don't have your hardware, but i would assume that some function
is provided on your laptop to do what fn+f7 does on mine.

when i do things this way, the x server picks a decent vertical
refresh rate (about 75 hz) for my crt-based external monitor.
i leave the lid open and use the internal keyboard for everything.
the internal display is black from the moment i press fn+f7 the
one and only time. =a0i leave the lid open and i use the internal
keyboard for everything. =a0everything, text mode virtual terminals
and the graphical x server, stays on the external monitor.
