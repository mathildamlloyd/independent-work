 i'm trying to wrap zope up behind apache, so i can do virtualhosts for
zope.

 i've a site on http://ip:8080/mysite.

 i want that to appear as http://mysite.com/ - so:


        servername mysite.com
        documentroot /var/www/mysite
        rewriteengine                   on
        rewriterule     ^/(.*)    http://localhost:8080/mysite/$1 [p]


 now, what happens is that apache grabs http://localhost:8080/mysite/ and spits
it out to the browser. lovely. all works.

 except for framed pages (like zope's management interface). it ends up
looking like:

    







 and of course, that's not what my client should go to. any ideas what i'm
doing wrong ?
