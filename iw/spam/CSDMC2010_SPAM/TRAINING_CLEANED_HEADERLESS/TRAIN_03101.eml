hello folks,

i don't know when it happened but it must have been during some
"aptitude upgrade" run lately: my console font turned from white to
cyan. at first i thought that the red vga signal had a bad contact,
but x came up in full color. console apps can control the color to a
certain extent, but the default color is a really gross cyan which
produces weird color effects on an lcd with the thni terminus fonts.
in other words, i can't live with it. where is this controlled, and
how can it be switched back to white again?

regards,
robert
