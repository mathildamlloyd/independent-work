some are included in the tarball provided by the linux kernel team, which i=
s=20
distributed under the gplv2.  in particular, i am thinking of the iwl3945=20
firmware that is required to run my wireless card.

it doesn't matter what upstream wants to call source code.  the gpl(v2)=20
defines it as the preferred form for making modifications.  (gplv2, section=
=20
3.)  it is unlikely that the firmware was written in a hex editor (or=20
equivalent).  most likely it is c source for a freestanding (non-hosted)=20
environment with some manufacturer-specific libraries, but it could also be=
 in=20
some manufacturer-specific assembly code.  either form would be better for=
=20
making modifications than a binary blob.
