just a side note about java/java plugin download from oracle/sun site.

last time i had to install it in that way on a linux system i needed to 
make a symlink for the plugin to work in firefox, as described in the 
installation guide ("enable and configure" section):

http://www.java.com/en/download/help/linux_install.xml#enable

but nowadays, the proper way for setting this should be using "update-
alternatives" as you mentioned above. 

what is the output of "update-alternatives --display firefox-
javaplugin.so" command?

mine shows:

stt008:~# update-alternatives --display firefox-javaplugin.so
firefox-javaplugin.so - el estado es auto.
 el enlace apunta actualmente a /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/lib/amd64/
libnpjp2.so
/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so - prioridad 63
actualmente la mejor versin es /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/lib/amd64/
libnpjp2.so.
