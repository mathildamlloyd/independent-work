you must be kidding. or at least you must be unaware about the existence 
of pdftk toolkit, itex and gnupdf library, xournal or pdfedit, a set of 
applications and frameworks available in this "gnu/linux world", intended 
for pdf editing and manipulation.

there is more than pdf/a (a pdf spec for archiving purposes) out there. 

have you ever heard about pdf forms (editing required), about adding 
bookmarks inside a pdf file structure, about making annotations or 
markups or just creating a link?

there are many situations where the user has the pdf file but lacks the 
original document, and if you want to perform any modification in that 
file, we (linux users) are stuck :-/
