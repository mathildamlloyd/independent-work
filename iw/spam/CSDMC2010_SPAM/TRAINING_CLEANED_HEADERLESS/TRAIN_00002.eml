bonding is not suitable for you because it works too low-level (it is=20
layer 2), unless you have two links from the same provider, using some=20
technology that can be bonded (like adsl).

afaiu what you need is bgp[1], but i can't give you any tips as this is=20
way out of my league ;)

probably a good start (whatever technology you end up using) is a=20
gnu/linux (preferably debian) machine connected to both internet links=20
and your internal network since consumer gateways don't even have more=20
than one wan port[2].

[2] some of them could be used for this with custom firmware, but this=20
is off-topic
