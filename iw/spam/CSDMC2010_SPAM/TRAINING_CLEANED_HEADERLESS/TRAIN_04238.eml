not unless you want to upgrade your entire system to sid.  to install
only certain cherry-picked applications from sid, you have to use
apt pinning.  and don't use synaptic.  (but since you don't have x
running, you can't use synaptic.  yet.  but once you get it running,
don't use synaptic.  i've heard that it does not respect apt pinning.)
