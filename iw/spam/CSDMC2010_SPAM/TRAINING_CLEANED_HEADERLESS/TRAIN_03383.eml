hi, list!

i have a few simple questions for you:

1 - i there a better place to get help with dash
2 - is there way to detect that a script is running as dash, instead of a
shell like solaris' /bin/sh
3 - corollary to #2, can i expect dash-as-sh to by a hard link or a sym
link?   (i would think not, but don't know debian's policy here)
4 - reason for #2, is there a way to list all functions declared in a script
with dash?  under solaris' shell, bash, or the korn shell i can use
"typeset" -- i've searched posix and don't see a way that doesn't involve
parsing the script.

thanks,
wes
