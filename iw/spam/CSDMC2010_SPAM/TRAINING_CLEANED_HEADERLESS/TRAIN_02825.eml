                              here falls shoe two

         well, it's getting late, and the government hasn't fallen,
         so we better roll the presses on the bad news. the campaign
         for digital rights published its first in-depth analysis of
         the eucd. for this exciting installment, cd-r has
         concentrated on what it does to people who have to
         circumvent copy protection to do their job. the short
         summary is: if they're not a teacher, a prison warder,
         disabled, or the cops, they can forget their jobs. if you're
         anyone else - like a musician, or a cryptographer -  and the
         copy protection says you can't make a backup, you can't. and
         even if you *are* a teacher or other exceptional person,
         you'll have to ask the secretary of state if you can crack
         the protected cd. in writing. each time.

                                     - oh, don't worry, it gets worse

                                   - what you can do to stop all this

         but there's plenty more to ooze out of the law than that.
         one of the big questions about the eucd is "is it the
         european dmca, or what?". well, the dmca spurted bad juice
         in many different directions, but one way in which the two
         are similiar is over "circumvention devices". distributing
         decss, the dvd lobby have claimed, is a crime under the
         dmca. decss is code that was also a magically dangerous
         artifact: a circumvention device. circumvention devices are
         about to become illegal here. specifically, three months in
         chokey (or two years if you really nark the judge), for
         those who "distribute otherwise than in the course of a
         business to such an extent as to affect prejudicially the
         copyright owner" one of them. "otherwise in the course of
         business" is legalese for "as an ordinary punter", so it's
         not just mod-chip sellers who are liable. anyone who
         distributes such satanic machines is also a perp.

                                   - what you can do to stop all this

         that's not going to go down well with andrew simmons.
         regular ntk readers will remember andrew as a lightning rod
         to lawyers. not only was he john doe #13 in the american
         decss case, but in a completely unrelated affair, he waws
         threatened with all manner of nastiness just for publishing
         his list of doomed dotcoms on his website [ntk 2000-09-22].
         in the last week, he's had another letter via demon, finally
         ordering him to remove his shiny "circumvention device" (aka
         decss) from his site. it sounds like the lawyers may have
         shot their wad a tad early: the eucd rules don't kick in
         until christmas. but when the new laws do hit, and if what
         andrew's preposterous correspondent says is believed in a uk
         court, hosting decss *will* mean jail. there's been some
         talk about how the eucd rules are better than the dmca,
         because they specifically exclude computer programs from the
         new rules. well, it looks like decss is no longer just a
         computer program. from now on, it could become a special "nick me"
         tag for your website.

         the crazy counterintuitive conditional probability world of
         bayes theorem has a reputation for making judges look stupid
         in dna-testing murder cases, and search-engines look even
         stupider when they suggest "relevant documents" - but it's
         getting a bit of a re-renaissance in the spam filtering
         world. tradition states naive bayesian alone doesn't work
         well enough at filtering by example, so it's good to see
         dozens of people independently sloshing around the noospere
         looking for better tweaked solutions. including, of course,
         leading noosphere cadet eric s raymond, whose bayesian
         bogofilter is fast, has extra smarts, and is up to version
         0.2. unfortunately, as with raymond's abandoned kernel
         configurator and recent anti-gay anti-islam anti-vegetable
         rants, it requires taking on board just a *bit* too
         much extra baggage to really take off. rennies' ifile around
         has been around for a while, and has support for mh and
         mutt. gary arnold's bayespam is something he knocked up in
         perl for qmail; a good start if you want to try this
         yourself. which you should, because nobody's cracked it yet.

         "attack of the clones" open in la. even though this was only a
         local newspaper, the judging panel felt he deserved the full

         ostensibly pointless nature of the entire exercise. that's the
