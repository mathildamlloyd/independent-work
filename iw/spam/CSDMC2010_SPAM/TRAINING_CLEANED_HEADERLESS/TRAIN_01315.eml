nfs as a protocol is not known for its speediness but this is absurd. i did an 
nfs install of a box this morning (that would be the box which won't boot 
from cd for those who were in irc) and it was rather slow but i just left it 
to it. having got it up, i want to copy the dvd to a disk on it so i have it 
handy for installing any further bits i might require. so i simply mounted 
the nfs exported dvd on the new box and started copying. 

after a couple of minutes i looked - it was transferring about 8mb a minute. 
so i killed that and used rsync instead which is ticking away now at about 
100 mb/min - still not exactly turbo charged but a lot better than the nfs 
rate. any ideas as to what's making it so slow ? there's really no point in 
running more nfsd processes, as there is exactly one client, so i'm a little 
at a loss i must say.
