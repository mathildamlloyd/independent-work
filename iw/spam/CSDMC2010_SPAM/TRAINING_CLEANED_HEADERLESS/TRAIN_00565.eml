yes, in stable, it's a mix between hal/udev and desktop environment mount 
system.

i suppose debian follows fhs ("/media" for removable devices and "/mnt" for 
temporarily mount points) :-?

on gnome yes, users can mount/umount their own usb devices via nautilus.

there must be some pre-made applications to get that but you can also try 
to get it done with udev rules. a quick example, courtesy of google:

you can use /media, and as boyd already suggested, give the device a 
label to get a static name so it always get mounted under the 
same path, i.e., "/media/mygps".
