today's error(received multiple times) was:

jul 23 21:16:39.288680 report[98557]: [ 2]  razor-agents v2.12 starting

jul 23 21:16:46.597147 report[98558]: [ 1] razor-report error: reportit:
error 213 while authenticating, aborting.

i really like the concept of razor but i find myself wondering if it's
really a good idea for the developers to be passing off what appears
to be alpha-quality software as production-ready....
