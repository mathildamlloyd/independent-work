thats cool. what about lots of little files? that was another of the draws
of reiser3. i have a space i mount on /media/archive, which has everything
from mp3/oggs and movies, to books to a bunch of tiny files. this will
probably be the first victim for the xfs test partition.

nilfs2, btrfs and exofs are *definitely* still beta or even alpha.

define "hates sudden power outages"...is it recoverable?

thanks for the info, ron,

does anyone have suggestions and practical experience with the pros and

xfs is the canonical fs for when you have lots of big files. =a0i've al=

es? that was another of the draws of reiser3. i have a space i mount on /me=

unch of tiny files. this will probably be the first victim for the xfs test=
 partition.

nilfs2, btrfs and exofs are *definitely* still beta or even alpha.

xfs and ext[34] can all be extended. =a0for production servers with a worki=
ng ups, i'd go with ext3 for / & /boot and xfs (since it hates sudd=
