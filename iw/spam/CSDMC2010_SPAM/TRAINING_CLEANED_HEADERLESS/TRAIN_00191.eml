the easy way is just to install whatever microsoft or whatever os you
have in mind:  it should overwrite the mbr.  indeed, the problem is
usually _preventing_ this from happening, as microsoft corporation's
installers seem to forever be overwriting your mbrs when you least wish
it, without asking your permission.
