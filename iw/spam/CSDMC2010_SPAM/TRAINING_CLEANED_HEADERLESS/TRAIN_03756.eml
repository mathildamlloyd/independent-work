what about a java launcher stub. use runtime exec to launch a java  
process. i think this is what the apache common launcher project code  
amounts to. it is based on the tomcat or some such product launcher  
code and uses a ant task approach but i think in the end just amounts  
to runtime exec'd java. assuming you can decide at runtime what  
parameters you want to use.
