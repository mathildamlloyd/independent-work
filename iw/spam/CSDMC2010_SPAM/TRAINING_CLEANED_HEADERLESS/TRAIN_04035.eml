i'm sure chuck doesn't deliberately leave any apple user group off his  
list of forthcoming meetings :)

but your query got me thinking about a few things...

how many apple user groups actually maintain a pr mailing list?

if you do, who do you include on it?
is chuck from the mug center on it?
sandy, the editor of the apple user group bulletin?
the apple user group resources website team?
your apple regional liaison?
lynn and fred's infomanger?
are other apple user groups in your 'area' included?
what about pc-based or adobe based user groups?
your local newspapers, community radio and tv stations?
local mayor and other local councillors?
your local apple retail store?
your local apple reseller?
your sponsors and advertisers?
what about your own committee/board of directors? and even your own  
members?
anyone else?


what information do you send out to the pr list?
just an announcement about your next meeting?
what about a teaser for the next three meetings?
how often do you send them out? weekly, monthly, or just when you have  
a 'major' event?
how far in advance of your meeting do you send them? the day before? a  
week before? two weeks before?

do you send html based emails? or just plain text?
do you keep an archive online of your past press releases on your  
website?


if you don't have a pr mailing list, why don't you?



please reply to the *_list_* so everyone can benefit from your  
responses :)
