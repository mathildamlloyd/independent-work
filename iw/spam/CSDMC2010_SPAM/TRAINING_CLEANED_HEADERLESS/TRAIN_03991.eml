actually the more i think about it, the more i realise that i would rather have 
some kind of full blooded monitoring app which lets me see stats (or even charts 
like ntop) of internet speed over the week, although i bet that is just dreaming.

i read one thread somewhere out there about apps like cacti, zenoss and 
groundwork - if you know anything about such packages, then you know more about 
them than me: is this kind of package remotely suitable or am i barking up the 
wrong tree?
