a website i want to use would allow access unless my java applet is jre
6 update 13 or higher.  as far as i can figure out the applet provided
by package sun-java6-bin is update 12.

- from the sun microsystems site i downloaded file jre-6u19-i586.bin;
moved it to directory /usr/lib/jvm, changed ownership to root:root and
permissions to rwxr-xr-x and ran the binary.  it created a new directory
/usr/lib/jvm/jre1.6.0_19 and opened in that directory a number of
subdirectories and files.

next, i needed to add this new jre to /etc/alternatives.  using the
alternatives configurator provided by package galternatives, as root i
selected 'java' as the alternative to configure and added to the options
list /usr/lib/jvm/1.6.0_19/bin/java and finally selected this new option.

after reloading iceweasel, about:plugins still showed the previous jre i
was using, /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre/bin/java.

assuming that i can use a later version of jre downloaded from sun on
iceweasel 3.5, am i on the right track but did not get the newer version
set up correctly, or is there a different way?
