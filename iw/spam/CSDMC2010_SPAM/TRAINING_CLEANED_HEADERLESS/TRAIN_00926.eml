i used to install japanese fonts via aptitude.  but i rather think that they 
were installed by default on my most recent installation, so i can't speak 
for now.  try "aptitude search " and see what happens?  or do a 
google/linux search?

which east asian fonts are you wanting, if the language is not in the list?
