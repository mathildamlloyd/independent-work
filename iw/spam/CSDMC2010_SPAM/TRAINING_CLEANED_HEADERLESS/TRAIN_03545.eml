i think that perhaps there is some language barrier.

your original post indicates that you want lines 1, 2, 4 and no others outp=
ut. =20
"i want only output the first, second, and fourth line"

your most recent post says that is "the problem".  which i infer means=20
something you don't want.

could you maybe rephrase the question, or at least be a bit more verbose?

=2e..

if you want the output to go to a file try something like (sed -ne '1,2p;4p=
'=20
"$input" > "$output").

=2d-=20
