  | hmmm, i assume you're going to report this to the nmh folks?

yes, i will, sometime, after i look at the nmh sources and see what
they have managed to break, and why.

but we really want exmh to operate with all the versions of nmh that
exist, don't we?   the patch to have exmh do the right thing, whether this
bug exists, or not, is trivial, so i'd suggest including it.

patch follows ...

i have no idea why the sequences were being added after the message list
before, not that it should make any difference to nmh (or mh).   but since
i stopped doing that, the variable "msgs" isn't really needed any more,
rather than assigning $pick(msgs) to msgs, and then using $msgs the code
could just use $pick(msgs) where $msgs is now used.   this is just a
frill though, so i didn't change that.
