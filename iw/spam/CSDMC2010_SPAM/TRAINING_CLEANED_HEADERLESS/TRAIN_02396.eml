        i don't particularly want pim, either.  kpackage, iceweasel, ksensors,
nut, wine, and wireshark are all i really care about.  only ksensors
and kpackage require kde.  you say, "no way to keep all of kde..".  i
don't care about all of kde.  i only want kdm and the utilities i
listed above, plus of course the terminal servers.

        that's really bad news.  without kpackage, there really isn't much
reason to run kde.
