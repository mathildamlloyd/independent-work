this is happening due to insufficient write access to the
"razor-agent.log" file. i was getting the same error, but
only as a non-root user.  as a quick workaround, you can do
"chmod go+w razor-agent.log".

in agent.pm, when then the logger object is created, it
doesn't check whether the logfile is writable by the current
user. then, when a write attempt is made, it bails out with
the "unblessed reference" error.

hope that helps,
michael
