ehhh?  ianahnbarhe -- rhl 8.0 is fully python-2, with a back
compatability v 1 shim set.  this has been working and freely
available in their raw hide for 5 months for early adopters
and back-porters.

red hat maintains binary compatability across major releases.  
its server management tools are heavily python, and becoming 
more so.

to have added mid-stream the python-2 series in the rhl 7.x
series would have been quite disruptive to an existing 
installed base.
