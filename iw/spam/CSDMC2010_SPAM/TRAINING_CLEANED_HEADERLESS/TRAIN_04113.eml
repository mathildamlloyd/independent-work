thanks lads,

i didn't mean to criticise/give offence or anything (someone mailed me off
list who seemed to think i did) but i was just wondering "if anything could
be done" about those messages.
maybe it was a stupid question, seeing as i know virtually nothing about
mailman, listservs, or server side spam filtering, but thanks for answering
intelligently!
