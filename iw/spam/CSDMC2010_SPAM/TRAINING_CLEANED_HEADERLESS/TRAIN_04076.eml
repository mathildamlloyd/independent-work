i reran the experiment (with the new spamham1.pik, but it doesn't seem
to make a difference).  here are the clues for the two spams in my
inbox (in hammie.py's output format, which sorts the clues by
probability; the first two numbers are the message number and overall
probability; then line-folded):

    66 1.00 s 'facility': 0.01; 'speaker': 0.01; 'stretch': 0.01;

    0.99; 'content-type:multipart/related': 0.99; 'economy': 0.99;
    'economy"': 0.99

this has 6 content-types as spam clues, only one of which is related
to html, despite there being an html alternative (and 12 other spam
clues, vs. only 6 ham clues).  this was an announcement of a public
event by our building owners, with a text part that was the same as
the html (afaict).  its language may be spammish, but the content-type
clues didn't help.  (btw, it makes me wonder about the wisdom of
keeping punctuation -- 'economy' and 'economy"' to me don't seem to
deserve two be counted as clues.)

i've been looking into hotels.  i poked around expedia for availability
from march 26 to 29 (4 nights, wednesday thorugh saturday).  

i've also started contacting hotels for group rates; some of the group
rates are no better than the regular rates, and they require signing a
contract with a minimum number of rooms sold (with someone financially
responsible for unbooked rooms).  most hotels are less than responsive...

radission - barcelo hotel (dupont circle)
$125/night, $99/weekend

state plaza hotel (foggy bottom; near gwu)
$119/night, $99/weekend

hilton silver spring (near metro, in suburban md)
$99/hight, $74/weekend

windsor park hotel
conn ave, between dupont circle/woodley park metro stations
$95/night; needs a car

econo lodge alexandria (near metro, in suburban va)
$95/night

this is a hand picked list; i ignored anything over $125/night, even
though there are some really well situated hotels nearby at higher rates.
also, i'm not sure how much these prices reflect an expedia-only
discount.  i can't vouch for any of these hotels, either.

i also found out that the down season for dc hotels are mid-june through
mid-september, and mid-november through mid-january.

this one has no mime structure nor html!  it even has a
content-disposition which is counted as a non-spam clue.  it got
f-p'ed because of the many hospitality-related and money-related
terms.  i'm surprised $125/night and similar aren't clues too.  (and
again, several spam clues are duplicated with different variations:
'hotel', 'hotels', 'hotels.', 'subject:hotel', 'rates,', 'rates.'.

i also looked in more detail at some f-p's in my geeks traffic.  the
first one's a doozie (that's the term, right? :-).  it has lots of
html clues that are apparently ignored.  it was a multipart/mixed with
two parts: a brief text/plain part containing one or two sentences, a
mondo weird url:

http://x60.deja.com/[st_rn=ps]/getdoc.xp?an=687715863&context;=973121507.1408827441&hitnum;=23

and some employer-generated spammish boilerplate; the second part was
the html taken directly from the above url.  clues:
