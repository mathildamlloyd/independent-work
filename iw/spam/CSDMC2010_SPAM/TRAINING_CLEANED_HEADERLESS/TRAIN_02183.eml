hello=2c

i was hoping to get some feedback or tips on how to setup a pci serial card=
 (not onboard) for kernel message log capturing. i am using debian lenny x6=
4 with the grub2 bootloader.

this might sound like an easy question=2c but does the linux kernel module =
have to be compiled with the running kernel in order to log messages at boo=
t time? i mean obviously the driver is required to be loaded in debian gnu/=
linux when the serial/com device is used in conjunction
with /dev/ttyd[01].

i have found a website providing patches for the chip on the pci serial car=
d i am using at:
http://izto.org/mcs9865/

does debian not include drivers for serial cards in any packages or would t=
hese drivers be considered non-free?

thanks.
