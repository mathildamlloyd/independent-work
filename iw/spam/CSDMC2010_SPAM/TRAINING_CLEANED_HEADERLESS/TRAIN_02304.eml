i just opened a new writer 3.2.0-9+b1 document then selected the 
"title image" http://i.space.com/images/080702-voyager-01.jpg from 
http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/nasa-tracking-voyager2-problem-100506.html 
and pasted it into the document.

no errors, hangs or "quits".

an example would help.

i selected all of the early life section, copied it to the clipboard 
with edit->copy then bounced over to a new writer document and 
pasted it with edit->paste.  no problems whatsoever.
