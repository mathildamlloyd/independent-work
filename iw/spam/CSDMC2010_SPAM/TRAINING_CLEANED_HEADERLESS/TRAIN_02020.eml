$ /sbin/modinfo ecb
filename:       /lib/modules/2.6.32-4-amd64/kernel/crypto/ecb.ko
description:    ecb block cipher algorithm
license:        gpl
depends:       =20
vermagic:       2.6.32-4-amd64 smp mod_unload modversions=20

(i use the full path because modinfo is in /sbin, which is usually not=20
in the user's $path).

but if you are curious only about the hardware related modules lspci=20
will tell what modules are used by the respective hardware. you will=20
need to run it as root with the -vvv parameters.
