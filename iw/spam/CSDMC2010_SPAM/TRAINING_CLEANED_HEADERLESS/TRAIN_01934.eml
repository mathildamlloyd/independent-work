  the growth in sales is primarily due to the euok brand becoming more es=
tablished in the premium cosmetic channels.  


 
  



  euok current trading price of 0.40 is a steal. we have been following t=
he cosmetics and beauty industry now for quite some time. according to fo=
rbes.com who did an article on the growth of the cosmetics industry, beau=
ty products generate nearly 230 billion annually in global sales, with a =
consumer preference placed on products that are high tech and natural bas=
ed (favoring companies like euok). with the current status of the company=
, euok is poised to grab no less than 1% of global sales, ensuring 230 mi=
llion in gross sales for euok. based off revenue alone that would warrant=
 a $6.57 share price.


 
  



  the financials speak for themselves; euok is set to make a run and is e=
xtremely undervalued.


 
  



  in the past, large multinational corporations have dominated the market=
 place, but in recent years boutique brands such as euok have been at the=
 fore front of consumer spending. euok is ready to take full advantage of=
 this. data released from the npd group (a marketing info company based i=
n new york) says luxury cosmetics have grown at an annual rate of 4% - 7%=
 since 2002. estee lauder and l=e2=80=99oreal have realized this and have=
 been acquiring companies like euok in order to meet the demand of consum=
ers.



  there are several reasons behind the growth in high-end cosmetics: the =
expansion of new markets in russia and asia; changing social norms that m=
ake using cosmetics--not to mention undergoing cosmetic surgery--more acc=
eptable; celebrity worship; promotion within fashion magazines; improveme=
nts in the technology that creates makeup; the influence of mass retailer=
s that can offer lower prices, and raising affluence. as cosmetics become=
s less expensive, better and more accessible, more affluent women--and in=
creasingly men as well--have moved away from older brands of makeup and s=
kincare in search of higher-quality new products and more exclusivity. 



  euok recognizes this and has gained retail distribution worldwide throu=
gh its relationships with department store retail giants such as barneys =
new york, saks fifth avenue, bergdorf goodman, neiman marcus, bliss, harr=
ods (london), printemps (france), la rinascente (italy) and lane crawford=
 (hong kong).



  upper management of euok has a three prong approach to further drive gl=
obal brand recognition:


 
  



  north america 

  euok strategy in north america is one of strong luxury brand positionin=
g through partnerships with premier department stores and flagship locati=
ons. euok department store partners include bergdorf goodman in new york =
city, barneys new york nationwide, ogilvy, as well as boutique-style depa=
rtment stores across usa and canada. euok also operates brand-owned flags=
hip stores in toronto and vancouver. euok subsidiary, hewitt-vevey, is po=
sitioned in medical facilities and online, with p
lans to grow in both directions. future expansion plans include creating =
new partnerships with other major department stores, as well as positioni=
ng with 5-star hotels in key markets. 

   

  europe 

  euok distribution in europe varies by market but is restricted to luxur=
y channels that position the brand amongst the leading luxury skincare br=
ands. our representation includes department stores and perfumeries in ma=
jor markets. these channels include printemps in france, harrods and libe=

untries. expansion plans for europe are focused primarily in the uk and f=
rance with negotiations with premier department stores under way.
