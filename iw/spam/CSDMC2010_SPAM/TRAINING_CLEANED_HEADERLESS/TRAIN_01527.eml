i have a similar one:
bubba calls up the dea and tells em that joebob is growing pot and 
hiding it in his back yard.  they go over, find nothing, and go ask bubba 
what he was talking about.  bubba tells em it's in joebob's woodpile.  so 
they go chop up all the wood and look through it and scatter it all over 
the yard, but find nothing.  they ask bubba again, and he tells them that 
joebob must have already sold it, so they leave.  bubba calls up joebob:
bubba: you get your wood chopped?'
joebob: yep, thanks, i'll give ya 15 bucks tomorrow.  (:
