hi ladies,

i setup a cron job to do a full backup to tape drive there last night, but
i'm just wondering how i can verify that it actually ran? 
i suppose that a mail will be sent to root as i ran crontab -e as root. is
that correct or should i be looking elsewhere?

thanks to everyone who replies in advance. 

best regards
cw
