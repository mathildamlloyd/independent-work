with regard to the noise produced on the microphone when plugged into the
sound card, try the sound card drivers available here,
 www.opensound.com/oss.html . thought by some to be superior to alsa.

##### 2 - my microphone works with lots of noise.
hi! i have a problem with my microphone. it works with lots of noise and re=
corded sound is very-very quiet or simply there is no sound but only rhythm=
ical crack. this result changes when i change in alsamixer l r capture para=
meter (capture [db gain=3d6.00, 6.00] - lots of noise and quite sound, capt=
ure [db gain=3d30.00, 30.00] - rhythmical crack). maybe this is a problem o=
f bad configuration. who can help?


i have not only one parameter but two parameters l r capture and now i was =
talking about the first of them. when i turn the second parameter a bit up =
from null than that is a loud siren. who knows this problem?

this happens with my inner microphone in acer 5220 and with my microsoft li=
fecam under ubuntu 9.04 (mint 7).
this is about my sound card:
00:1b.0 audio device: intel corporation 82801h (ich8 family) hd audio contr=
oller (rev 03)
subsystem: acer incorporated [ali] device 011f
control: i/o- mem+ busmaster+ speccycle- memwinv- vgasnoop- parerr- steppin=
g- serr+ fastb2b- disintx-
status: cap+ 66mhz- udf- fastb2b- parerr- devsel=3dfast >tabort- <tab=
ort- <mabort- >serr- <perr- intx-
latency: 0, cache line size: 64 bytes
interrupt: pin a routed to irq 21
region 0: memory at fc300000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=3d16k]
capabilities: <access denied>
kernel driver in use: hda intel

thanks,
