i just checked in a code cleanup which doesn't address this issue, but does 
take a machete to code right around it.  you ought to 'cvs update' and see if 
your issue becomes any clearer with all the brush removed.

my patch notes that 'msgid' and 'line' are redundant with one another and removes 
one or the other from functions which takes both.  the callers are then 
changed to pass what the function expects.  in the case of msg_change, the 
'line' argument is removed and we only have the msgid argument.  ftoc_clearcurrent
is now the first line of msgchange.
