yes, that seems to what was happening. i have remove the pci-e card and
the machine was able to detect the onboard vga chipset (using module
radeonhd).

at the moment, when i boot, i get 1024x768 resolution on both of them
(monitor and tv) with both showing the same image. i have tried to
create an xorg.conf using
http://wiki.debian.org/xstrikeforce/howtorandr12 but it is not being
applied (both outputs have 1024x768 resolution even though i have
specified the preferred resolution in xorg.con). does anyone see obvious
mistakes in the file or if i have missed something?

thanks,
ks.
ps: i just realized that i could have used a dvd-hdmi adapter for my
nvidia 8600gts card too. however, its fan is really noisy :(
