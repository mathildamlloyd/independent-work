i get a zillion of these, every single day, about every 5 minutes or so:

2010-05-24 15:05:38 smtp call from localhost (dovidhalevi) [127.0.0.1] 
dropped: too many syntax or protocol errors (last command was "mail 
from: size=8814")

i am running exim4 heavy on a sid box.

exim shows no stuck messages or such. how can i stop this?
