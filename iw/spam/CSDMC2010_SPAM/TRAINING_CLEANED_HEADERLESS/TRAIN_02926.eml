the modem is communicating with the system over a driver. you have to find
out how to setup the modem on system level. this has to be done prior to
get it used by an application like a dialup program as wvdial.

i setup last year two huawei modems and failed to setup one. as people
posted the product/vendor ids are crucial for the system to load the
appropriate setup and as far as i remember not all huawei modems are
supported under linux by the fact that some chipsets are not supported.

good luck
