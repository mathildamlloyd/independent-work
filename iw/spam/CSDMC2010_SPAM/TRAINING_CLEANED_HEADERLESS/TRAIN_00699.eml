this is something that often annoys me. programmers can spend hours inlining
code and relying on optimisation tools to improve performance. the best
performance improvement can be obtained by fixing the algorithm.

most function calls get made very rarely. optimising them often makes no
sense, produces illegable code and nonsense algorithms.

inlining will help in functions that get called frequently and are small -
such as string manipulation routines. but these are a small part of most
applications.

one example i frequently see is people optimising a database function call.
most database accesses involve many abstraction layers and millions of
instruction cycles. trying to save a few instruction cycles would be a cost
saving of, say, 5 seconds in 20 hours.

but a simple hashmap cache of common data without any compiler or inline
optimisations can turn that same 20 hours into 10 minutes.
