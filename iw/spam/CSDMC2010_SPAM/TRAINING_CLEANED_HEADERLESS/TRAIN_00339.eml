as a sid user you are certainly aware of the differences between
'safe-upgrade' and 'full-upgrade' and i would be interested in the
actions proposed by aptitude if you run a full-update.

i assume that this will allow aptitude to take actions which are more to
your liking as you obviously don't like the ones proposed by aptitude
when you run safe-upgrade.

thanks for testing a development branch of debian :)
