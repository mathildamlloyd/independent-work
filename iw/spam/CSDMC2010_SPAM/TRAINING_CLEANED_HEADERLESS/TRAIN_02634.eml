hi again:

i have a big nfs partition shared and mounted on 3 debian serves
(mountpoint /snapshosts). nfs partition es ext3 and i have a backup
script, on every server, which makes a tar from some   lvm snaphost .
i mean, my 3 servers maek their tar backup at the same time on
/snapshots nfs partition. this partition is only use to make this
backups. my question is:

is recommendable to use  gfs or other filesystem insted of ext3 in
/snapshots nfs partition?
any other recommendation?

thanks in advance.
