supporting and testing unreleased or beta software is the biggest problem. =
if=20
you want your pet issue fixed, you have to get akonadi from trunk, build it=
,=20
test whole debian's kde 4.4.x *extensively* with it including third party=20
akonadi plugins like googledata one. finally severe regressions should be=20
fixed. for packaging, readme.debian needs to be written on how to switch db=
=20
backends since there won't be gui for it. and when this is done, that akona=
di=20
could be considered for stable.

in other words, you have to do part of upstream release management work=20
without knowing the code well. you can be sure that upstream won't be pleas=
ed=20
with debian releasing unreleased version of akonadi. but maybe you can=20
convince them otherwise to release earlier to accommodate debian needs. the=
re=20
is lots of work to be done.

initial akonadi trunk packaging is at [1]. i have been using it with sqlite=
=20
for over a month now. yet i don't use akonadi features extensively (not eve=
n=20
addressbook or korganizer) so i can't tell much about quality of the code. =
but=20
i can tell you that if you don't step up, this plan probably won't make it.

it might be a problem for some people (short on ram on their machines), not=

problem for others. generally, you need to stop talking and generalizing wh=

you don't know (like keep claiming that releasing with different versions=20
wasn't considered despite obvious proof on the contrary).

postgresql/sqlite is a feature, it is not a bug which has to be fixed no=20
matter what. if you want it in, stop ranting and start working on it. give=
=20
fewer lessons how debian works and actually do something useful towards you=
r=20
goal. especially since the lack of technical knowledge or background should=
=20
not be the problem for you.
