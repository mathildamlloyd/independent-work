hmmm, strange. well maybe kmail does address completion more directly than=
=20
via kaddressbook. there might be a component in kdepim libs doing that for=
=20
kmail. for - just for looking up email address - kmail really calls into=20
akonadi.

but afaik it doesn't use akonadi - through what ways ever - for anything=20
other than retrieving contact data. thus the use of akonadi could not be=20
that wide-spread in kmail.

however, kdepim will use akonadi more and more, so imho its better to have=
=20
akonadi improved and fixed than to remove the akonadi dependency in kmail=20
temporarily.
