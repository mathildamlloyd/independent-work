i may be a light debian user. 'cause i simply use gnome power manager as
battery tool, supposed to be the default power manager in gnome. i think it
is kind of dull. i've found battery using up much more quickly under debian
than it under windows(yes, i'm using a dual-booting laptop).

so, is this just because i choosed a unsuitable tool? or it has any other
reason. in the comparison mentioned above, i was doing some file work and/o=
r
running emacs

of course i am sure that you know you are posting about ubuntu to the=

and say you are running debian when posting to a debian list. =c2=a0:-)

i have often wanted this too. =c2=a0and your other wishlist items as =
well.
as far as i know there isn't a tool that does exactly this for
gnu/linux in general or on debian in particular. =c2=a0if you find one i
would be interested in it.

there are some useful tools available though. =c2=a0you might look at '=
ibam'.

 =c2=a0ibam is an advanced battery monitor for laptops, which uses
 =c2=a0statistical and adaptive linear methods to provide accurate
 =c2=a0estimations of minutes of battery left or of the time needed until
 =c2=a0full recharge. it requires apm, acpi or pmu.

it needs some training. =c2=a0but given that it does perform fairly well.
unfortunately it isn't tied into the system tray tools and so isn't=

going to be a seemless integration there. =c2=a0it is available in gkrellm<=

if you use that stack. =c2=a0see the gkrellm-ibam package.
