re 1. your swap partition's uuid must be different. check
"/etc/initramfs-tools/". there is a "resume" file (in that dir or in a
subdir) that will have your swap partition's uuid.

re 2. what do you mean by "after changing the uuid of the new
partition"? after "dd...", did your run "tune2fs -u ..." on your root
partition (or the equivalent for xfs, ...; i am assuming that you have
just one partition)? if you didn't, your root partition still has the
same uuid and update-grub is picking it up correctly (in which case, i
have no idea idea how you are booting up!).
