i do have the following as part of my sources.conf:

deb http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile lenny/volatile main
contrib non-free
deb-src http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile lenny/volatile main
contrib non-free
deb http://www.debian-multimedia.org lenny main

i am not sure if i actually installed anything from volatile.

yes, from debian-multimedia.org. presumably that counts as non-debian.

sorry to sound stupid, but how do i activate those? right now i don't
see any icons on the desktop when plugging devices in.

yes, the pmount works fine now, it did not even require setting anything up.
