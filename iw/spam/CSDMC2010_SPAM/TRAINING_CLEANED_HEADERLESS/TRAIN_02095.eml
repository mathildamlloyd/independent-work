this is exactly the problem i saw when i updated x11 to 2.5.0 (mouse 
button 2 sends leave/notify instead of buttonpress or buttonrelease), and 
as a matter of fact i went so far as to open a ticket on it.  it was 
marked invalid a short while later when i reported that the problem went 
away with a reboot.



since that ticket was closed, i have seen the same problem on a second 
system running 10.5.8 (a powerbook g4 15").  a reboot also solved the 
problem on the second system.  unfortunately i haven't seen the problem 
appear again on either of my two systems, so i can't offer any help in 
root causing it.
