oops, i tend to feel like that most times! i tend to feel that if we
have extremely good compilation tools, then those tools should be able
to do the inlining and optimisation far better than i could. that's the
theory anyway :) and there's always a tradeoff with inlining between
speed and memory bloat (which may sometimes be no tradeoff if swap
starts getting involved...)

gary.
