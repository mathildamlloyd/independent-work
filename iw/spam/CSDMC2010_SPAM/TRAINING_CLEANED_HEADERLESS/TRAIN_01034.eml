hi all,

i am using dsl [ damn small linux ] which is branched from debain.
i am trying to use gcc, gdb.  able to install both of them.

i am doing following
     - run a helloworld.c program whic has a while loop.  so while
running, its stuck in while.
     - another shell, "kill -11 pid" [ pid of the ./a.out ]
after kill, i get segmentation fault.  but core is not dumped. [ i
expect a print ( core dumped ) ]

anyone faced this ??? please help.

thanks
- avinash
