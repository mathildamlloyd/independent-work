i am continuing to suffer the on-going de-volution of the once-decent
epiphany browser under debian squeeze.  first they broke file
downloading.  they still haven't fixed that.  i'll bet it's been
six months or more.

now i can't reply to any e-mails using the wow basic
webmail client.  i click on the "reply" button, the mail compose
screen appears for a fraction of a second, then i get this error
screen.  the problem does not occur with iceweasel.  the problem is
very recent.  it broke with a recent
"aptitude update;aptitude full-upgrade" sequence.  i suppose i could
report a bug, but i'm not about to give them my password so they
can logon as me to test it!  i'm going back to iceweasel again.
i kept using epiphany so i would know when the file download feature
got fixed.  instead they broke something else.
