valuable yes, since it provides useful video processing apps. i'm using
it also since recently. it probably is reliable, although for me it did
  break vlc the moment i started using it.

good to know.

how come there is no link anywhere on debian.org pointing to
debian-multimedia.org? anything to establish a chain of trust. as it is,
i looked and looked but didn't find. even when searching for
"multimedia" on debian.org, it does not mention debian-multimedia.org at
all. not even when searching for "debian-multimedia". every new debian
user trying to verify the credibilitiy of debian-multimedia.org would
have given up at this point for sure.

with the information that marillat is a debian developer (and the
precise spelling of his name) i was actually able to go to the
developer's page on debian org, find him, and see a link to d-m. so in a
very roundabout way, d-m is actually endorsed by debian.org. but how
would anybody find out about this in a reasonable amount of time?
