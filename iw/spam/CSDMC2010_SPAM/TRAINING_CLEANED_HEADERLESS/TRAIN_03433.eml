if you are asking what i think you are asking, as in which files would you
need to restore your system in the event that you lose your apt and dpkg
databases, then i do the following:

/var/backups
/var/cache/apt (less /var/cache/apt/archives)
/var/lib/apt
/var/lib/dpkg

this will give you enough that apt-get update, etc works. now the rules have
probably changed if you use aptitude as i believe it creates/uses a
different database.
