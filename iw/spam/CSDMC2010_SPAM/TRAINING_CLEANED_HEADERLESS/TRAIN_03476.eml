yes, another interesting way to use mplayer. you can use the
-dumpaudio option to get the raw audio data out of the file.  i am
usually not trying to get the raw audio however, because it might be
compressed or encoded in weird ways. i usally want to have a nice
uncompressed wav file that i can work with. and mplayer is pretty
handy for that...

so many choices!
