i would appreciate it if you could get gabber packages for red hat 8. i 
will be making a new release soon, but even in the meantime, 0.8.7 
packages would be ok.

i know that in the beta, red hat was using a modified version of 
gnome-libs which is incompatible with the latest gnomemm. if this is 
still the case in 8, i can send you a patch which makes gnomemm work 
again...
