hello:

i=92ve recently had a few users get new snow leopard machines.  they all =
are having problems similar to those described in the =93fileid race =
detected=94 (jan 19, 2010) of this list.  i share home directories using =
nfs (mac os x server 10.5.8).  my leopard clients do not exhibit this =
behavior.

the snow leopard clients are all patched up to 10.6.3.  i searched this =
list and did not see any information indicating that this bug, alluded =
to by jim luther (response to initial =93fileid race detected=94 posting =
also on jan 19, 2010), has been fixed by now.  does anyone have some =
concrete information about this bug?  thanks a bunch for your help.
