red hat 8.0 ships with the bytecode hinter enabled; i think 7.3 may have 
as well.

the enabling change to "ftoption.h" is made by red hat's srpm before 
building.  take a look at "freetype-2.1.1-enable-ft2-bci.patch" from the 
srpm; it's pretty clear that this does exactly what needs to be done.

so if your fonts look ugly, lack of bytecode hinting is *not* the cause.
