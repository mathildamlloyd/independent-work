this is exactly why display names were invented...

address:       abs@example.com
display name:  alphabet soup

or

address:       zw@realss.com
display name:  zhang weiwu, support engineer

and something called a signature, which is where you should put all that other
crap:

office it services of icd ss

to try to jam all of that information into the smtp address itself is silly.
again, this is what display names and sigs are for.
