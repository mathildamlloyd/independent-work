  | hmmm, i assume you're going to report this to the nmh folks?

it turns out, when i did some investigation, that my memory of how mh
worked here was wrong (that's not unusual) - the -seq switch seems to
have always done -nolist (requiring a subsequent -list to turn it on
again).

given that, i have no idea how the pick code as it was ever worked.  in
fact, it quite possibly never did the way it was intended to (i have just
been browsing the 2.5 sources, and that seems to be attempting to do things
that i never saw happen).

it may be that your new sequence method just exposed the bug that had been
there all along.

given this, i won't be sending any bug reports to the nmh people.  if nmh
ever seems to be showing any signs further progress, and if i remember this
then, i might send them a change request.   the code to make the change is
trivial.
