i'll always be slowly catching up on comp tech. 

i was using knoppix and clamav to remove a virus for a friend when the
futility of it all hit me.  the free anti-virus hopscotch game that windows
users play to feel safe.  what wasted energy--over an os i boot into maybe
7% of the time.  they screw up half the time.

there isn't a big demand for clamav on the debian partitions of a
laptop/desktop.  but i'll be scheduling scans of the xp partition from
debian.  doh!

there is even a clamav *win32* for the unlucky.
