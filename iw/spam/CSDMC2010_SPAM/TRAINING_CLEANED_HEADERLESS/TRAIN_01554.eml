hi,

in my build scripts, i have problems with some of the kernel packages.

for kernel-sources, i get :

package kernel-source is a virtual package provided by:
  kernel-source#2.4.18-3 2.4.18-3
  kernel-source#2.4.18-3 2.4.18-3

on running apt-get install kernel-source

now, first of all, this doesn't really tell me what the two options are ;)
second, is there some way i can tell apt-get to install either ? this is 
done from automatic build scripts so i'd like it to proceed anyway.

thanks,
thomas
