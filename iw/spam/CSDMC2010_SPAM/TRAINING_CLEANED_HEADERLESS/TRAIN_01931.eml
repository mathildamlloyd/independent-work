but colossus was not for enigma. the bombes used for enigma were
electro-mechanical. i'm not aware of any application of optical techniques
to enigma, unless they were done in the us and are still classified. and
clearly, the first bulk breaks of enigma were done by the bombes, so i
guess it depends whether you count bombes as computers or not, whether this
statement has any credibility at all.
