new freeware download







it's
        free!




 




includes the same
advanced defragmentation technology
used in diskeeper 7.0.






much faster than the
previous
    diskeeper lite and all built-in defragmenters.






now runs on windows
nt/98/2000/xp.


millions of downloads attest to the popularity of
diskeeper lite, but it only ran on windows nt 4.0. now it's been updated
for all
windows operating systems from windows 98 onward.
new diskeeper lite is still manual-only and cannot
be
scheduled or run across a network, but it is far superior to any built-in
defragmenter and much faster. and it will show you why full-version
diskeeper is
the most recommended automatic defragmenter ever built. 
find out what you are really missing.
free!
