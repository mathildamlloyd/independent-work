glenn fleishman's written an open letter to the infoworld writer who published 
an hysterical ambivalent article[1] about warchalking: 

    the only place i hear about these stories on warchalking that relate to 
    stealing access from open, but not shared aps -- accidentally shared, i 
    suppose is accurate -- is via law enforcement without any specific 
    locations mentioned, arrests made, or even photos of the offending marks.
