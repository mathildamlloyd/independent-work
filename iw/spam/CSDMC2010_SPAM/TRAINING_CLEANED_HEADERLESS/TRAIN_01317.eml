hi tim,
it isn't a "version" of anything except nextstep, with a mac hackjob.
it has a bastardised, but functional bsd -layer- which sit's atop mach and
uses case insensitive hfs+ but it isn't really a bsd.

(here's a neat trick, touch "makefile" and "makefile", notice the lack of
error message but the absence of "makefile", and don't bother formatting for
ufs. the apple ufs implementation performs like a dog, was frozen in 97,
implemented badly and has not been updated since. hfs+ get's tweaked every
now and then, but enough screaming has them looking at shoving ufs2 in there
somewhere down the road. )

then there's the holdover next inherent weirdness, such as multiple versions
of common unix files, but none of them do anything, and all changes you
would usually append to them have to go through netinfo manager.

all in all, i find it to be a functional, if not overly quirky desktop
environment.

as for your initial question,

regards,
mark.
