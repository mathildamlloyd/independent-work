it is almost like the old days of potato and woody. had to fresh up my 
old brain again.   so i installed nvidia-glx and the other required 
packages. that 's nowadays much easier than in the wiki thanks to apt if 
you start with 

after that i put the appropriate sections in my /etx/x11/xorg.conf. 
nvidia instead of in tel and i made a module section with load "glx" in it.

i restarted the x-server and now *everything is working like a charm*

he camalen, i really owe you, man! you really helped me out.

many regards,

steef
