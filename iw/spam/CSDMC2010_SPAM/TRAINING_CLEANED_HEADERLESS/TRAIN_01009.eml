***
limits

max number of files variable, allocated at creation time[1]

[1] the maximum number of inodes (and hence the maximum number of files 
and directories) is set when the file system is created. if v is the 
volume size in bytes, then the default number of inodes is given by v/213 
(or the number of blocks, whichever is less), and the minimum by v/223. 
the default was deemed sufficient for most applications. the max number 
of subdirectories in one directory is fixed to 32000.

note that "the max number of subdirectories in one directory is fixed to 
32000."
