yup. i do agree here, however, e.g., the cocoa(touch) framework already =
requires "no blocking, all user interface operation on the main thread". =
if apple then says: "all your bluetooth communication has to be on the =
main thread, too", it does not restrict the rules set up by the cocoa =
framework any further. so, if rules for apps are already set by the os, =
your library would not restrict anything by saying it must be started =
from the main loop and the main loop cannot block.

the pure select()-based runloop for non-gui applications. the wiimote =

are you asking about btstack? if yes: the btstack client  library does =
not provide a way to choose a run loop, but as it is only using =
thread-safe socket functions, that could run on any given thread. if =
there is a clear need for such a feature, i would't mind adding a "set =
default runloop" function. would that help you in any way?
