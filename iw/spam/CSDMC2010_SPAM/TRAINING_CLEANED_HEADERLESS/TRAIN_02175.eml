i'm also not familiar with the implementation, but i would prefer that
automatically installed packages stay automatically installed, so that
they have the possibility of being automatically removed when no longer
needed.

i use "hold" liberally to weather sid storms.  there are two cases i
see crop up: one, aptitude suggests removing packages without an
obvious replacement.  two, aptitude marks things as broken that have
been working just fine.  in either case, i start slamming the "=" key
until packages will no longer be removed, and nothing is marked
broken.  this works 99.99% of the time.  at some later period when i
suspect the storm has passed, i test the waters by unholding the
packages and gauging aptitude's reaction.

i also use "hold" when apt-listbugs + some investigation leads me to
believe i'm better off with the current version.  (there's some reason
i don't use forbid-version, but i don't recall.  maybe it wasn't
persisting between sessions?  but that would have been years ago.)

all of which is to say, just because i've marked a package on hold
doesn't mean that i want it on my system forever.  but if that's the
only way to deal with the problem, then i can certainly manage.  my
system is ancient, and there are already plenty of package on it whose
presence i can't easily explained.  what's the harm in a few more?

if this is a misuse of "hold" and there's a better way, though, i'm
all ears.  rereading, it seems like "forbid-version" would be the
right call for most of what i'm doing, assuming it does persist
between aptitude sessions.
