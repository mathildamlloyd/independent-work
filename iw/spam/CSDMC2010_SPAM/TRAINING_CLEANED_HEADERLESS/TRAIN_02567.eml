 true, but that's the thinking of today, that the company mailserver can be
closed to you from the outside; because as it is today you can use any mail-
server that you've got access to. if there's a good reason for setting it up
they won't be that lazy in the future.

 a simple rfc could fix that today, either using a new header or extending the
received-header with a code/value that the server later on can verify; maybe
something like this:

received2: date: [date];
local: sub.dom2.tld (ip#2);
remote: sub.dom3.tld (ip#3);
env-id: 
code: [cache#, salted hashvalue, rsa or other signature]

 and then you have the two optional from and to, only added by the sending
server that's identified the local sender or the server accepting mail for a
certain user (to verify that it did really come via that server, in case you
forward it using procmail or something like it).
 you of course would need some standard for how to check these headers.

 not perfect, but better than what we have today.
