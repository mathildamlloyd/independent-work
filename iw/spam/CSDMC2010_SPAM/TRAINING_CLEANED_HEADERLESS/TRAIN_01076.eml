can't comment to that. as far as i know 'anyone in the know' would  
have to be apple or the originator to view that radar.
you don't indicate the situation where you run into the bug. have you  
considered using anything besides sun java.util.zip?
this for one turned up quickly looking for (googling)
java.util.zipfile compatible

a pure java implementation of the java.util.zip library

http://jazzlib.sourceforge.net/

which in turns mentions jzlib which i think i looked at before.

i support some of my own zip related code but not really compatible  
to zipfile. not doing much with it. plan to probably return to it  
sometime after 1.7 provides the long awaited pluggable filesystems.
