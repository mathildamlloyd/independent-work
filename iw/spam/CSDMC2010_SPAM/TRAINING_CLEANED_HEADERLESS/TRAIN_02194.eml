hello all,

i just received a notification that meta-kde 5:59 has entered unstable/sid.
with that, the meta package kde-minimal does no longer exist, so /usr/share/live-helper/lists/kde-
core should be updated and possibly again when 5:59 gets into testing/squeeze.

this is the contents of that file now (primairily for debian-kde list):
#if distribution lenny
kde-core
#endif
#if distribution squeeze sid
kde-minimal
#endif

kdm
desktop-base


i think the following change should correct the change in the meta-package:
#if distribution squeeze sid
kde-minimal
#endif

becomes:

#if distribution squeeze
kde-minimal
#endif
#if distribution sid
kde-plasma-desktop
#endif

and when 5:59 gets into testing it should become:
#if distribution squeeze sid
kde-plasma-desktop
#endif

i'm cc-ing debian-kde list, since they probably can add sth useful to this.

regards,
   diederik
