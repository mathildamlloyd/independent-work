hi sven,

thanks for that suggestion. i had seen that bug and discounted it
because the patch is only effective if smtp_tls_capath is set, and
mine wasn't set. but your mail prompted another look, and with both
smtp_tls_capath = /etc/ssl/certs and applying the patch from #287795,
it banished the "certificate verification failed" and changed
"untrusted tls connection established" to "trusted tls connection
established".

so that's progress :-)

unfortunately it's still failing to authenticate. from mail.log:
may  9 21:49:18 rimmer postfix/smtp[8121]: 5de243a66: to=, relay=newserver[newserver-ipaddr]:587, delay=5.5, delays=0.02/0.03/5.4/0, dsn=4.7.3, status=deferred (sasl authentication failed; server newserver[newserver-ipaddr] said: 535 5.7.3 authentication unsuccessful)

thanks,
clive
