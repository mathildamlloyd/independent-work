- presuming your run bash  :
note the directory lists 
#  perl -e 'map { print "$_\n" } @inc'
then set up the shell variable perl5lib variable (and put it in some .bashrc 
for future use)
# export perl5lib="directory1:directory2:directory3:directory4"
then try to install the software

perl5lib is explained perlrun(1) : do 
# man perlrun for more information
