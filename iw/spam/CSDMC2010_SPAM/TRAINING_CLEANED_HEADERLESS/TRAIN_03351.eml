there's also an 'objdump' program, and 'biew' hex viewer/disassembler. a good 
starting point to search is http://www.freshmeat.net/

however, cracking and reverse engineering tools are not so ubiquitous on unix as 
they are on windows platform for two main reasons:

1. the main customers of commercial unices (solaris, hp-ux, aix, sco...) are 
respectable companies. they are ready to pay big bucks for software they need: the reputation matters.

2. most software for free and open source unices like linux and xbsd (this 
software often may be used on commercial unices as well) is, well, free and 
open source.
