openprinting.org has a by-manufacturer listing grouping all the 
"perfectly" working printers together, then the "mostly" then the 
"partially" and "paperweight".

for example:
http://www.openprinting.org/printers/manufacturer/epson/
http://www.openprinting.org/printers/manufacturer/fujitsu/
http://www.openprinting.org/printers/manufacturer/hp
http://www.openprinting.org/printers/manufacturer/dell

even though it's marked as "mostly", i really like my dell 3100cn 
color laser printer.  it's *big*, and was $350 about 5 years ago but 
being laser printer is toner-based, and powder doesn't dry out.
