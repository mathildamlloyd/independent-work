i don't know if there's a sendmail-ish way (it's not in the -d0.1 output),
but this should work:

$ strings `which sendmail` | grep -i milter

if you get a long list of function/message looking phrases, milter
is built-in.  if you get something like:

warning: filter usage ('x') requires milter support (-dmilter)
milter warning: option: %s requires milter support (-dmilter)
@(#)$id: milter.c,v 1.1.1.2 2002/03/12 18:00:36 zarzycki exp $

then it's not built-in. :)
