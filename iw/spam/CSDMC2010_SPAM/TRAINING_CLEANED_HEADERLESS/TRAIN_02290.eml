the only moderately famous schoolmates i have are both (now) freelance
tech journos. one, gordon laing, used to be editor of personal
computer world (personal page http://www.glnow.com) and the other
(laurence grayson) seems to pop up frequently in zdnet publications 
(http://news.zdnet.co.uk/story/0,,t269-s2070948,00.html reveals the
accurate statement "nobody does mournfully better than laurence"). i
have the satisfaction of knowing that the former is now raving bald
and that i once stole the latter's girlfriend.

oh, yes, nearly forgot ramon tikaram (tanita's brother) who's gone
from "cutthroat island" to the series "this life" and has now reached
the dizzying heights of "crossroads". he isn't a half bad musician,
actually. he was a year or two above me at uni, so i'm not sure that
he counts.

my uncle was at oxfnord with alan bennett and a few others whose names
i forget.

my wife tells me that someone she was at school with became one of the
teletubbies (well, they were from st just, what can you expect) and
another (who rev joe might know) is now a movie special-effects wizard
called bellamy (possibly "pete", definitely not "david").

and then there was the time i nearly knocked harold wilson under a
train....
