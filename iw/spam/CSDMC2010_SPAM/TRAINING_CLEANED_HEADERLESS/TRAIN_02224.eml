the kresource api is public api of kde4, it can at best removed at the firs=
t=20
kde5 version (which is probably still several years away).
some of its plugins are public api as well (those from kdepimlibs) so they=

stay too.
problematic are plugins from kdepim, they can be replaced by respective=20
akonadi base resource implementations.

right, i think it will run if it does not find its configuration, thus not=

knowing whether it has already run.
could lead to duplicated resources on akonadi side though (if it has been r=
un=20
before).
