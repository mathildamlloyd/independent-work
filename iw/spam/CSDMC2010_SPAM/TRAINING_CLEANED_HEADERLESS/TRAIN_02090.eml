this is hardly a new book.  in fact, it was written in the days of woody.
(woody -> sarge -> etch -> lenny -> squeeze)
and parts of it are obsolete.  but the author focuses on the core stuff of
unix/linux, and so most of it is still current.  it's an excellent guide
for how to accomplish common computing tasks in linux, usually with a
command line tool, and the author has a clear bent toward debian.

this is the original version of the book, and it is free.  there's an
expanded 2nd edition available in hard copy for a fee.
