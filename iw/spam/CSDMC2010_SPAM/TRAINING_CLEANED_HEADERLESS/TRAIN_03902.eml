hi guy,
                the problem is caused by an npe in the swing =
accessibility code when a jlist subclass overrides the =
getaccessiblecontext() method and returns null. you can hit this crash =
when using a tool that scans the intellij ui using the accessibility =
api. we believe we have a fix for it, but as a workaround if you avoid =
using tools that use accessibility with intellij, you can avoid the =
crash.

thanks,
bino george,
java runtime engineer,
apple inc.
