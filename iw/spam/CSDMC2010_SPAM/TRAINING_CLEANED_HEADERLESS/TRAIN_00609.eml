i digged a bit about how the kerneloops daemon works and i guess it does 
not use e-mail but some kind of mix between dbus system to gather 
information about the crash and then it sends the report to the url 
defined in "kerneloops.conf" file:

http://submit.kerneloops.org/submitoops.php

if you directly load that page, it says:

***
200 thank you for submitting the kernel oops information remoteip: [...]
***

although nothing was send :-p
