anyone have a copy of bell centennial i can borrow? i wonder if i'll ever have 
$100 to spend on fonts. (matthew carter, i'd be happy to pay you the two cents 
in royalties you probably get for selling $100 worth of fonts.) 

*update:* kevin marks[1], who is stupendously incredible for far more things 
than i can list here points out that gill sans (which i was asking for earlier) 
is _included with os x_. i knew mac os x included a lot of great fonts[2], but 
i don't know how i overlooked this. _awesome!_
