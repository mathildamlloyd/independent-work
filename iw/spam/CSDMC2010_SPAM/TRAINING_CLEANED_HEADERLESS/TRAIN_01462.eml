ok, noone has been tool-less for memory management for a long time. most
systems you just add a flag and memory is tracked (that's how i've always
done it) or worst case yuo have to run it through one of the 2.3e7 tools
where you simply recompile and it it tells you where the leaks are.

memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any idea at all how the
hardware functions. granted, this takes 30 minutes to go over, and so is far
beyond the scope of the "learn java in 90 minutes without thinking" book
every java programmer learned from.
