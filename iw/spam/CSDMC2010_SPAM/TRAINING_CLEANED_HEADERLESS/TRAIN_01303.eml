so, as you already discarded flashplayer as unique source of your 
reboots, i will take a look into:

1/ system overheating (reboots tend to happen due to high temperatures, 
watch the bios cpu temps and control the rpm of the fans).

2/ ram memory modules and voltages. check the ram dimms are certified for 
you motherboard and also, look into the bios voltages are the correct 
ones for you type of ram.

3/ hard disks health. you can test this with "smartcl".

being a brand-new computer i would suspect for bad hardware or assembly 
problems :-/
