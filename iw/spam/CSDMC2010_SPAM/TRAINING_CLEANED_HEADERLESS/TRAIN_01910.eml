i hear you.  i'll have to look at the code to see if that's easily separated
out.  i started with the purpose of adding an enhancement to support cms
formatted disks.  i stumbled across the bug in the starting block calculation
for ldl formatted disks in the process.  cms formatted disks are handled
*exactly* the same as ldl formatted disks if the disk is not reserved.  i
would have had to fix that bug anyway to add support for cms disks, since
i wanted the cms support to be correct.  the only wrinkle was correctly
handling reserved cms disks.  to do that i had to access the reserved block
offset in the cms label, which prompted this thread.

all of this is specific to the s390 architecture and has no bearing on i386,
amd64, ia64, etc.  i hope upstream (gnu, i believe) will accept the fix.
i have no reason to believe that they won't.
