um yeah, i suppose that'd be useful info...  western france, la rochelle

i guess that requires something more in the way of budget then...  given
that this monitor was serving as the single monitor for 4 boxen (via a
4-way vga kvm switch), i'd be looking at investing in 4 dvi cards along
with another kvm to suit while a vga version _should_ just plug into
