hi,

i have the huawei e1762 usb dongle running under lenny and squeeze
using pppd as were i live i have no access to dsl or cable.

with lenny you need to install the the kernel 2.6.30 from debian
backports[1] first, as the 2.6.28 kernels onwards will flip flop the
device for you. at the moment it maybe just being picked up as a mass
storage device and not a modem if you still using the 2.6.26 kernel.
and if you want to stay with the 2.6.26 kernel you will have to
install usb-modeswitch[3].

setting up wvdial this might help you[2].
