the missing link | scot has cyber tomb with a view

sometimes an epitaph just can't be the last word. billy kemp was a
great scot who died a couple of years ago at the young age of 52. he
was a councilman, husband, father and pillar of his community. his
family couldn't possibly post all that on a tombstone. but they did
manage to fit http://www.billykemp.org.uk/ on there. yep, kemp's
tombstone doubles as a billboard for his web site, created
posthumously by his son as a tribute to his father's life. the grave
site has gotten more than 33,000 hits, perhaps more visits than the
gravesite!
