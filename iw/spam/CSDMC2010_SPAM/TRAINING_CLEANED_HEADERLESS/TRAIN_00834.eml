a book for every geek: want to know more about 
networking? 
have you ever wanted to 
write an e-book? maybe you need to polish 
your 
web design skills? get full-length books from the poor richard's 
series, including poor richard's e-mail publishing, by chris pirillo, at gnometomes.com, for 50% off the suggested retail price of the print versions. 
click here to learn more.    

i'm now twice a published author. earlier in the week, i released my  
top 50 mac os x tips, 
which marks the only thing i've ever written that i 
expect anyone to pay for. if you happen to use os x, go check them out. 
my second publication is a pdf only explanation of the process for 
converting vinyl lps to cd, by way of your pc (how's that for alphabet 
soup). for the time being, you can get it absolutely free, with the 
caveat that i'd appreciate some feed back on what could be added to make 
it more useful (i'm considering some screen shots for it if i get some 
time). what are you waiting for -- 
get something free already.

with the expiration of lockergnome's old cell phone plan, lori and i 
opted to make a switch to verizon, at the recommendation of brian 
stevens. i'm already happy with the suggestion, as our previous provider 
had horrid customer service, not to mention i now have a much geekier 
phone in the form of the 
kyocera qcp 6035 
palm powered unit. it's just 
larger than most palm devices on the market, but having the device 
integration is nice. it has all the functionality of a palm, with some 
internet browsing capabilities and of course, phone access. a built in 
speakerphone actually works better than i expected,  now all i need to 
do is get more applications installed.

of interest to anyone who signed up for 
emusic after chris and i talked 
the service up and down last week: it seems they've added in the ballpark 
of 1,000 universal titles to their roster of offerings. not surprising 
considering they're part of the same conglomerate, but still good news 
in terms of feature expansion.

gif movie gear v3.02 [1129k] w9x/nt/w2k/xp $40
http://www.moviegear.com/gmgdet.htm


the majority of gif animation on the web does absolutely nothing for 
me. i'm of the mindset that animation is meant to either tell a story 
or illustrate a concept -- not put something in motion just because 
you can. that said, for anyone wanting to create animations, this tool 
makes it nice and easy. a storyboard interface keeps you thinking like 
a movie maker as you build your animated creations, which lends itself 
to helping anyone who'd like to get from point a to point b in an 
orderly fashion. the software supports psd, jpg, avi, bmp, and gif 
formats, leaving your options open for creating animated segments.

madshrimps extreme cdrom testing
http://www.madshrimps.com/index-e.php?action=webnews-e&l1;=0&l2;=30
 
a little on the childish side, but this cd-rom drive test is still very funny. 
watch as this group rewrites the rules on drive benchmarking. if geek tv were 
more like this, even non-geeks would tune in to watch (which probably says 
more than it should about the lowest common denominator). a wmv capable player 
is required,.

tapeheads (r) 1988
comedy - 93min
reviewer's tilt (2)


 
two out of work rent-a-cops make an attempt to break into the music 
video industry in this quirky comedy. john cusack and tim robbins 
make this comedy work, starring as the two security guards as they 
send up all sorts of hollywood stereotypes. you can't help but laugh 
at the ridiculous predicaments these two survive, as they are 
greeted with cameos by a who's who of music and movie industry names. 
i'm sure neither robbins nor cusack would openly list this movie on a 
resume, but it is indeed a brilliant performance by both of them, 
especially as a demonstration of their ability to play off of each 
other. although this is a late 80's release (one of the few 80's 
underground classics i hadn't previously seen), it remains relevant 
to those out there who are looking to put it to the man. if you've 
ever hated the recording industry and its in-crowd attitude, you'll 
love this film. a closing reference to rene's courtyard cafe in santa 
monica, which is a regular stop for me every time i'm in the la area, 
prompted me to want to watch the film for a second viewing. the movie 
is humorous enough for several viewings. nothing really grabs attention 
on the dvd, but then again, the studio probably expects no one will buy 
it anyway.
