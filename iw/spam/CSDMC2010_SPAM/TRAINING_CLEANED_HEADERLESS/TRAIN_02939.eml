hello,

i am having problems with the uvcvideo module (driver for webcam)
when resuming from suspend to disk on debian lenny (with the latest
updates) with a 2.6.30 kernel.

when i wanted to blacklist this module for suspend, i noticed that
it is already in /etc/hibernate/blacklisted-modules.

my hibernate.conf:
trymethod suspend2.conf
trymethod disk.conf
trymethod ram.conf

=> so i guess i am using swsuspend2, and suspend2.conf contains
the line:
include common.conf

and common.conf contains this:
unloadblacklistedmodules yes

so does this command cause hibernate to read
/etc/hibernate/blacklisted-modules, or do i have to add
unloadmodules uvcvideo
?

thanks in advance,
