hi,

when running pascal programs based on fpgui, an x11 based interface =
package, i get an error if the application needs to create the top level =
(root?) x11 window. but only then. if there is already a toplevel =
window, for example because xterm runs, then the application open its =
window and everything behaves as expected.

the problematic call is this:

xgetwmprotocols(fdisplay, awindow, @protocols, @count);

gdb shows these values (if there is an x11 window, the values are =
exactly the same):

4: count =3d 0
3: protocols =3d 0x0
2: awindow =3d 6291457
1: this->fdisplay =3d 0x803a00

this call produces this x11 error:

x error of failed request:  badatom (invalid atom parameter)
 major opcode of failed request:  18 (x_changeproperty)
 atom id in failed request:  0x0
 serial number of failed request:  103
 current serial number in output stream:  104

system: mac os x 10.6.3

x11 version:
michael% x -version
x.org release 7.3
x.org x server 1.4.2-apple53
build date: 20100211

someone suggested  xsync and xinteratom , but i am fairly clueless, when =
it comes to x11. so could you give me directions how to resolve this?
