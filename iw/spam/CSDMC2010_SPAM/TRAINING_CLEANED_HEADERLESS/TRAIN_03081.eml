jeremy zawodny[1] who works at yahoo finance offers an rss 0.91 feed for every 
stock. it's a beta feature. here's the feed for microsoft[2] and one for 
marimba[3]. thanks to jon udell[4] for the pointer. nice. jon also notes that 
microsoft doesn't show up too strong in the weblog world and describes[5] a 
conversation with john montgomery about this. what a small world. john and i 
got to know each other when we did the work on soap in the late 90s, and weblog 
software is one of the major reasons we were interested in soap. so close, but 
so far. but it's never too late!
