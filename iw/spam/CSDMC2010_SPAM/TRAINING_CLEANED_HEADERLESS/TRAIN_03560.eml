    zdnet delivers price-feature analysisvol 1, no. 2
-----------------------------------------------------------------

this week, we present a special shopper report featuring
four cool products. we have reviewed these products,
compared each to five products with similar features,
and analyzed the range of prices for each category. what
you'll see is a shopper tool we've dubbed the "price-feature
ratio analysis." featured products can fall in to three
stages of price-feature ratios:

stage 1: high price-feature ratio - technophiles will rush
to buy the product, but can expect to pay higher prices
for the honor of being the first among their friends to have one.

stage 2: variable price-feature ratio - expect high variability
in prices among products with similar features. it pays to
comparison shop for the best price.

stage 3: low price-feature ratio - when compared to products
with similar features, prices are low and don't vary much
from merchant to merchant. use our merchant ratings to
find the right one for you.

we have rated each of the products featured in this supplement
to aid your shopping experience.

kds rad-5 15-inch lcd

the lowdown: without our even hitting the power button, the
stylish kds radius rad-5 stands out from the pack with its
silver casing and blue highlights. turn on this basic,
analog-only lcd and you'll see an equally impressive image
at its native resolution of 1,024x768.
