at this moment, for me, kaddressbook?  akonadi did not  get configured right, i 
had to follow this advice to get it to start working:  
http://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=20&t;=79717&sid;=ce96096a96a9d8ca3ebb13105dce3d21&start;=10#p137002

having done that yesterday i noticed that the concept of contact categories is 
missing.  today i found that i only get empty dialogs when i attempt to edit a 
contact!  so for me kaddressbook is unstable.
