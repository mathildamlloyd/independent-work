curious.  i changed the arguments to ftoc_showsequences to drop the folder 
argument and instead have an optional msgids argument.  somehow your version 
of scanfolder is still trying to pass $f.  you seem to have the latest 
ftoc.tcl (1.36), but not the latest scan.tcl (1.27).

i don't know how that happened, but try getting your source tree completely 
up to date.
