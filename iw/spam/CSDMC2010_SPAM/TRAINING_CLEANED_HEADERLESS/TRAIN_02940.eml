i solved the overheating problems i had by using utilities
under vista enabled to set the processor for low frequency
operation (as opposed to dyamic frequency control), and to
select the power-saving mode.

one of the utilities was in a toshiba folder under all
programs, another was in the vista utilities folder.  (sorry
to be vague, i'm not keen to risk undoing my present success
to double-check. :-)

vista reported that the os would need to be rebooted
for the settings to take effect.

when i rebooted into linux, i discovered that the
fan would speed up at temperatures of 80c.
also, playing video no longer causes overheat
and shutdown.

idle temperatures are way down in a reasonable range,
around 60c.

the laptop uses insyde h2o bios, which provides
no facilities for setting power-related parameters.
fan controls and other functions are reportedly 
available via the omnibook module. i have yet to test
this, and no immediate need, having dealt with the
biggest thorn.
