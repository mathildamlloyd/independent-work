as per opensuse, yes, they have the obs (build service) with many 
packages up-to-date and available (backported or not) for the current 
supported releases *but* remember that packages that fall in there are 
not "officialy" supported nor included into security patches (they follow 
their own path to solve any issue that can arise). 

anyway, i agree their kde repos are of very good quality and so very 
useful for users.
