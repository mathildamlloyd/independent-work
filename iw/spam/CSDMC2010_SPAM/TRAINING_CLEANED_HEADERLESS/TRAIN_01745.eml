dear readers,
so far, 2002 has been a year marked with variations on earlier
worms. if you update your antivirus software on a regular basis,
these new versions of frethem and yaha shouldn't be a nuisance.
but if you haven't updated in a while, these variants--plus the
continuing threat of klez.h--should motivate you. in security
news, a flaw in certain versions of pgp encryption could affect
outlook users. read on to learn whether you're vulnerable.
 





















frethem.k worm wants to give you a password
 an e-mail message that promises to reveal secret information with
a password is yet another variant from the pesky frethem worm
family. frethem.k, technically known as w32.frethem.k@mm, also
called frethem.l by some vendors, uses its own smtp engine to
send e-mail using addresses obtained from infected systems. this
worm does not carry a destructive payload. mac and linux users
are not affected.



yaha.e screensaver worm spreading
 the yaha.e mass-mailing worm masquerades as a friendly
screensaver, proving that users worldwide are still opening
attached files from total strangers. yaha.e (w32.yaha.e@mm, also
known as lentin.e, yaha.f, and yaha.g) is a successful variant of
a worm first seen around valentine's day this year. thankfully,
this worm does not affect mac, linux, or unix users.






leaky pgp outlook plug-in 
pgp 7.03 and 7.04, widely used plug-ins for microsoft's outlook
e-mail client, inadvertently weakens security and leaves the mail
program open to attack. fortunately, there is a patch available.
