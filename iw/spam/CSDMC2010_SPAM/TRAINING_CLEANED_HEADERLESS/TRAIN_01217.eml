better yet would be a built-in server check on a periodic basis, even
daily, looking for the existence of an update, and if found prompt the
system admin to upgrade the server.  with the ever changing face of spam,
this would probably be a big benefit to sa users and help keep everyone up
to date.  we have not done this with too many of the apps we sell on
www.rosecitysoftware.com strictly because of joe-average-user concerns
about spyware and "phoning home", but in cases where the app needs to
access the internet anyhow, we have done it with great success and minimal
concern by our users.
