i'm helping a fella in the uk with a debian build (tiny web) on a small vm
machine in a data center.  i am trying to compile some c++ code, i have the
libs and binaries installed and the compile "works", except for this line...

i have a php file used to make the build, and the file contains these
lines..


system("g++ $files $incl $libs >& build.log");
#system("g++ $files $incl $libs");

the first line fails with an error "sh: syntax error: bad fd number".

if i comment out the first line, and uncomment the second line, i do get my
"a.out" file but the errors/warnings go to the screen...  how can i make
them go to the 'build.log' file?

i have done full package updates on the system using webmin, and everything
as of this morning is current.

thanks kindly for any assistance you can provide. :)
