rob "pringles can" flickenger and others cliff skolnik at the o'reilly os x con 
has tracked down the cause of the annoying flakiness in the wireless network 
here -- every 20 or 30 seconds, you start getting "connection refused" messages 
from your browser and other net-utilities. rob "pringles can" flickenger wrote 
it up. 

it turns out that running the great network-spy app etherpeg[1] (or other 
"promiscuous" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in os x at the same 
time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your 
segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a "rejected" message. 

so today, rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around 
and tell people running etherpeg to _turn off the firewall_ (and vice-versa). 
ah, fickle networking, you are such a stern mistress! link[2] discuss[3] (_
thanks, rob!_)
