on my white macbook (2007 eta) that i recently upgraded from leopard  
to snow leopard. i have installed all current updates.

now, and not before, i notice that frequently when i start to re-use  
the machine that it has zero brightness when it powers up. the  
'increase brightness' control has no effect (but other keys do work).  
if i close the lid but then reopen it before the machine goes to sleep  
that usually does the trick and i have medium(ish) brightness and can  
turn brightness up or down.

i am testing if this is related to x11/xquartz so thought i would ask  
here if anybody else has experience this problem.

i can provide more h/w details later.

thanks, m
