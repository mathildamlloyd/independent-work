anil dash discovers that the t-mobile sidekick's web-browser is pretty 
arbitrary in which pages it will load and which pages it will throw up its 
hands at: 

    so i decided i was going to modify my page to conform to your browser's 
    idiocy. i went looking for technical docs on what you do to mangle web 
    pages. none. i went looking for a desktop emulator that i could run to 
    simulate your device on my computer. none. i went looking to see an 
    acknowledgement of the shortcomings of your device, indicating that the 
    situation would be improved. none.
