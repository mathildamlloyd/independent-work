yeah, that would work, tho there are race conditions and likely/possible
ugly side effects (eg unintentionally left-over comp files).  i've ended
up taking a very different route: tmda (http://www.tmda.net).  in
particular i use tmda outbound filters to add custom plus addresses to
the messages i send to specific lists.

for example, for the tmda-users list i want a from: address of
claw+tmda@kanga.nu, so the relevant outbound filter is:

 to tmda-users@libertine.org ext=tmda

which rewrites my from: header transparently.  when i get next month's
batch of password reminders from mailman lists i'll be running about
resubscribing to each list either with a standard plus address or a
tmda-based sender address (ie an address which only the list in question
is able to send mail to).

  -+-

getting tmda fully happy with nmh was a minor pain.  

reasons:

  nmh, like mh, by default delivers outbound mail via smtp to port 25 on
  a defined host.  the port number cannot be configured (it calls
  getservbyname() which does a lookup against "smtp" in /etc/services).
  ergo, you are constrained to use tell nmh to use tmda-sendmail instead
  of smtp.

  using sendmail as the delivery method under mh instead of smtp is not
  recommended as is loses a number of useful bits of robustness in mail
  delivery failure modes.  further, when nmh is configured to use
  sendmail instead of smtp nmh's whom tool calls sendmail as follows:

    .../sendmail/ -m -t -i -bv

  which creates problems:

    postfix does not support "-bv" and returns in error

    exim does not support "-t" with "-bv" and returns in error

    don't mention qmail.  i won't use it.

  "whom" is far too useful as a component tool in mh to lose.  

    it would be nice if someone gave the new crew working on nmh a shout
    about this.  the "-bv" option to sendmail is pretty damned close to
    being allman sendmail specific and thus unfriendly to other mtas.
    further there are many cases where it would be useful to configure a
    non-standard port to deliver outbound mail to via smtp.  nmh's
    current insistence on only using port 25 (or as specified in
    /etc/services) is a pain.

i've worked out a hack to use tmda with exim while retaining nmh's
"whom" support using exim's system filter:

  0) make sure that the following options are set in ~/.tmda/config:

    datadir
    allow_mode_640
    crypt_key_file
    fingerprint

  1) chgrp everything in and under ~/.tmda to group "mail".

  2) configure exim as per the current tmda how-to.

  3) set the following options in exim.conf:

    message_filter = "/etc/exim/filter"
    message_filter_pipe_transport = address_pipe

  4) /etc/exim/filter reads:

    # exim filter
    testprint "local_part: ${local_part: $h_from:}"
    testprint "domain: ${domain: $h_from:}"
    if "$h_x-tmda-fingerprint:" is "" and 
       "${domain: $h_from:}" is "kanga.nu" and
       "${if exists {/home/${local_part:$h_from:}/.tmda} {true}{false}}" is "true"
    then
      pipe "/usr/bin/tmda-inject -c /home/${local_part:$h_from:}/.tmda/config"
      finish
    endif

  yes, that assumes that all user directories are under /home and that
  they use ~/.tmda/config instead of ~/.tmdarc.  hack appropriately for
  your setup.

basic explanation:

  exim sends all outbound mail thru the system filter (if one is
  configured) before attempting delivery.  the above system filter
  extracts the user from the from: address and pipes the message thru
  that user's tmda setup via tmda-inject.

  the system filter runs as the same user as exim, thus the requirement
  for the chgrp mail.  if your exim installation runs as a different
  user, chgrp as appropriate.

  it should be fairly easy to do something similar under postfix, but i
  haven't investigated that end.

notes:

  this requires that all outbound mail that is to be processed with tmda
  has a from: header which references a local user (suffixes are fine),
  and that the from: address is fully qualified with a known domain.  if
  you're vhosting the above setup would be fairly trivial to extend for
  other domains and $home paths.  i'm not vhosting on my desktop and so
  don't care.  you could also qualify on envelope or other headers if
  you wish.

  a nice side effect of this approach for those running shared mail
  servers is that all users who have tmda configs instantly get tmda
  support for their outbound mail -- and in a manner that is less
  complex and less prone to end-user error than the typical tmda
  configuration.

caveat emptor.  

  obnote: i've also written a small patch against tmda 0.58 to add a
  "hold" delivery method (identical to "confirm" except it sends no
  confirmation requests -- very useful for testing configs or doing
  silent sidetracking of mail).
