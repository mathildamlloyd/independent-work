and over the bridge and out into turner's pike walked steve hunter, the embryo industrial magnate. across the great stretches of fields that lay beside the road the wind ran furiously, tearing leaves off trees, carrying great volumes of dust before it. the hurrying black clouds in the sky were, he fancied, like clouds of smoke pouring out of the chimneys of factories owned by himself. in fancy also he saw his town become a city, bathed in the smoke of his enterprises. as he looked abroad over the fields swept by the storm of wind, he realized that the road along which he walked would in time become a city street. pretty soon i'll get an option on this land, he said meditatively. an exalted mood took possession of him and when he got to pickleville he did not go into the shop where hugh and allie mulberry were at work, but turning, walked back toward town in the mud and the driving rain. 
hamish, hamish, you are laughing at me! or you want to call me a coward? don't you know i should be afraid of the ghost of the shepherd who killed himself? don't you know that the english people call me a coward?

my obliging mathew would have taken me to other places of the like character; but inspir'd, as i hope and believe, by ye direction of ye spirit, i took upon myself to tell him what vain trifling is all such kind of pleasure. he argu'd with me stoutly, saying that ye king and queen, who are both shining examples of goodness and piety, do attend vauxhall and ranelagh, and are to be seen there frequent, to the delight of their subjects. on which i told him that, much as i esteemed my sovereign and his respectable consort, i would compleat my existence without having seen them rather than i would seek to encounter them in a place of vain and frivolous diversion. he listen'd to my discoorse in a kind and sober temper, but he was not convinc'd; for by and by he falls of a sudden to sighing and groaning, and cries out, 'o, i went to vauxhall once when ye garden was not many years made, and o, how bright ye lamps shone, like ye stars of heaven fallen among bushes! and o, how sweet ye music sounded, like ye hymns of angels in ye dewy evening! but that was nigh upon twenty years gone by, and all ye world is changed since then.' 
i'm sure i don't know how it happened, he said, but i overslept myself. i've only just waked up, and he'd play the devil's tattoo on me if he knew the letter hadn't gone. i know a famous secret, antoine; but don't say anything about it to the clerks if i tell you; promise? he would send me off if he knew i had said a single word; he told me so.
