subject: [camram-spam] another framework hashcash related framework

there is a framework for using a hashcash like proof of work function
as a way to frustrate junk mailers in this paper:

"curbing junk e-mail via secure classification"

by e. gabber, m. jakobsson, y. matias, a. mayer bell

in fc98.

online copy here:

http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/27735.html

(look in the view or download section at the top right, it's
availabile in at least .pdf and .ps formats).

the framework they propose with proxies etc looks a lot like the
current camram architecture, with a proof of work to get on a white
list.  they use target revokable email addresses (basically identical
to the lwpa concept) to implement the white list.

the resulting framework is essentially identical to what i proposed in
recent message with:

subject: target revokable email addresses, and postage-free tokens

their idea of including the postage free-token in the email address,
mirrors what is done in lwpa and makes the system exhibit smoother
migration for non-users.  eg. you can use varied sender addresses and
it will still work, you can forward the email address to someone else
and it will still work etc.

they have some software architecture diagrams and suggestions for
installing some of the proxies on a corporate gateway -- "gatekeeper"
they call it.
