------- additional comments from alan@rdrop.com  2002-09-05 22:22 -------
i haven't tried 2.41 yet because it requires file::spec, which barfs when
spamassassin tries to use it.  i haven't filed a bug yet because i suspect it's
because i'm still running 5.005 perl because of reported compatibility issues
with 5.6 and later, but i probably will because i think there's too much legacy
perl code to put up with major compatibility problems, and spamassassin didn't,
at least in the quickest of looks, say it needed a newer one.  the perl @ stuff
was bad enough...  but this is all a separate soapbox...
