hi all,

i am setting up a file server for a small company. the people who will 
be using it want to be able to control who accesses particular 
directories on a user/group basis. i originally thought that it would be 
enough to set up a standard samba system with unix home directories, 
plus shares for each group of users (admin / tech etc.), but they are 
keen to have a system which allows them to make some parts of the 
filesystem available to more than one group, which as far as i know 
isn't supported by this kind of setup. (unless i were to have shares for 
each possible combination of groups...)

i think that to achieve this i will need to set up samba with unix acls, 
but i'm not sure what's the best way of doing this - the two options 
seem to be using a patched kernel with an ext3 filesystem, or else using 
the xfs filesystem which has built in acl support. which of these would 
you recommend?

the xfs option seems a lot simpler to maintain (no need to patch the 
kernel every time an update is released), but i'm worried that because 
this filesystem is not used so much, it may not be as reliable as ext3.

thanks for any help with this,

andy baxter, lancaster uk.
