how about single user mode?  are you able to get virtual console there.
also try to disable gdm/kdm, see whether virtual consoles are working.

so are you still running nv?

yes


and what was the driver that wouldn't compile?
i run x86-195.36.15 on the latest sid kernel and it compiles just
fine, but i don't (yet) have a amd64 system.

indeed. forget this if it is beating a dead horse, but did you have
gcc-4.3 + gcc-4.4 both installed? i did and i set the symlink gcc to
gcc-4.3 and that got rid of the message.


thank you hugo, i managed to compile the proprietary driver.
now every ctrl+alt+fn leads to a complete black screen, with no prompt or c=
ursor or anything.
ctrl+alt+f7 works as expected.
could it be that my system stopped creating the consoles at boot time ?
what should i check and where ?

tia,
