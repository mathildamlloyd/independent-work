are there keycodes for cut, copy and paste? i tried using the
"obvious" xf86copy and xf86paste guesses but those did not work. for
that matter, where can one find a list of all available codes? i have
googled for various combinations of "linux debian keycodes scancodes
list" but found no such list!

thanks.
