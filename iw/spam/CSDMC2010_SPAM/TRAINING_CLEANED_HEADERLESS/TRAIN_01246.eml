one practice i've adopted is to list requires: only when they're
absolutely necessary.  this will help because some packages are named
differently between distributions (eg. sdl <-> libsdl), and the
dependencies are automatically handled by rpm by depending on shared
library names.

this doesn't apply to buildrequires: though.

use macros for directory names where available, eg %{_libdir},
%{_bindir}, %{_datadir} etc.

i'd like to suggest using as many rpm macros for command names as
possible too, but unfortunately i don't know of a definitive reference
about them...

i have a small redhat 7.3 rpm/apt repository at
, and i've received reports from people
running mandrake 8.x and suse that the rpms work with them out of the
box.
