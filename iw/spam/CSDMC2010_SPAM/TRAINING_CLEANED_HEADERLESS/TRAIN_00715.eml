yes, the plus is the correct model. i will have to look into it again, 
but i have 3 drives so they could not all be in the two yellow ports. 
this may also explain why fdisk lists my drives in the order: sdc, sdb, 
sda. running lspci -k, i don't recall seeing ata_piix at all.

thanks for the input, i will have another look tonight.
