#1 those of us who are envious of your success as a writer and artist
might find this a bit hard to understand.  

#2 once, when forced to mix with a wife's associate's [french] husband
who spent most of his time blowing his horn about how he had wined and
dined and hung out with the famous and wonderful, i became
progressively more and more jethro-like until i was using phrases like
"heehaw y'all -- you done talked to him!?"  my counterpart never
noticed my evolutionary decline, even as hair sprouted from my
knuckles, my forehead contracted, my eyebrows merged and i started
grunting.  fortunately, my wife intervened and i was prevented from
doing my moonwatcher imitation with the chicken bones left from
dinner. regression is a wonderful curative.
