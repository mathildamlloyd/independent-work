techs lose again with seibel earnings miss, aol questions

amid news the conference board's index of leading economic indicators held steady in june, broader markts also headed south. the dow jones industrials dropped 133.0 points, or 1.56 percent, to close at 8,409.4. the s&p; 500 slid 24.48 points, or 2.7 percent, to close at 881.56--another multi-year low.

j.p. morgan stays cautious toward qwest in tech notes 7/18/02 
analyst marc crossman repeats a "market performer" rating on the telecom firm and further lowers his estimates on what he sees as continued deterioration of qwest's local and long-distance businesses. crossman says qwest could violate a bank agreement by the end of this quarter if it doesn't close a significant asset sale. and he argues the firm faces a funding shortage next year that can't be satisfied by selling its eastern directories businesses alone.qwest communications intl inc 2.74 14.64%
