............and that is what i did. kaffeine is still giving trouble 
with mpeg4-files &&. so i loaded again the intel-driver. this driver or 
chip (x4500) is definitely of better quality than the combination 
geforce 9400 & and the nv-driver. my conclusion: no hardware-problem, 
just a disastrous by-effect of the latest nvidia-driver from their site 
on the hardware-combination (?)of my machine.

so be it till another nvidia-driver will come up or another pci-express 
card.

thank you very much, you all have illuminated me!
