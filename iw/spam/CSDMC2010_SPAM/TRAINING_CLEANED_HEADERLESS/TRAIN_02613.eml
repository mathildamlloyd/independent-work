ah, okay. so the decoding is being done on the sound card? in what sense
does the sound card need to support the file type?

most of the cheap in built audio cards could only support 16bit=
 44100hz/48000hz
so just see the specification of your audio card.
but audio players could down sample them to 16bit 44100hz/48000hz,
windows player may be doing that. =a0but of course, that reduces the
quality.
ah, okay. so the decoding is being done on the sound card? in =
what sense does the sound card need to support the file type?
