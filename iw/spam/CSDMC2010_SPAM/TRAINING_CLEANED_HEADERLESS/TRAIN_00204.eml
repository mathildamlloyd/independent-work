would you happen to have any links to such benchmarks, unofficial or
otherwise?

my experience has been that whenever i look at filesystem benchmarks,
they skip the many-small-files case.  i've always had the feeling that
most of the big filesystems cared a lot about scaling up in file-size,
but not too much about anything else.

i'm a reiser3 user myself, and i've never had any problems with it.

(the trouble with it being "long in the tooth" is mostly hypothetical,
isn't it?)
