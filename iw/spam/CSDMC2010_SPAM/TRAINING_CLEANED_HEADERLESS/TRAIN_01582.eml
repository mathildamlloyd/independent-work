(not disagreeing with the general point.)

for what it's worth, i've been running eclipse (on 10.6, 64-bit) with
the usecompressedooops option for months now - if anyone recalls, apple
fixed the issue with the default garbage collector so that it now
automatically chooses one that doesn't crash with that option - and it's
very fast.

of course, i only have my work computer to compare it against (which is
a pentium 4 pc, with a hard drive that appears to have some kind of
identity issue, since it obviously thinks it's a c64 cassette) - but
still, i don't notice any performance problems.

also note, i'm sure the behaviour is different on different benchmarks.
i did a quick search and found two benchmarks:

http://www.matsim.org/book/export/html/330
http://blog.juma.me.uk/tag/compressed-oops/

as it happens, both these show a performance win for the option, but
these are only two samples. i'm sure certain usage patterns are indeed
noticeably slower so i agree, if using cpu-critical code where
performance is a concern, it's probably best to work out a repeatable
test and try both options. just saying, 'assuming' is never a good idea,
but don't assume it'll be slower either. :)
