as nicely put in the reference (2.7.5):

"if the risk of breaking an existing stable system by the automatic upgrade 
is smaller than that of the system broken by the intruder using its security 
hole which has been closed by the security update, you should consider using 
[the] automatic upgrade [...]"

in other words, use automatic security upgrades if you can't maintain the 
system actively and have enemies.
