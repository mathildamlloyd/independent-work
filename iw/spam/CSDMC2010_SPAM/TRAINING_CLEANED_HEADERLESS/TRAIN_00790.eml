hello all
i'm looking for advice. my pc has developed a disturbing tendency of trying
to access ip 62.17.143.253 without my consent. it has got to the stage where
normal web-browsing is almost impossible.
i have checked ip address on ripe database and i know precisely who is being
called. i contacted that company on 14 july, when the problem first arose
and asked for a remedy but (surprise) got no reply.
a helpful person on the ie.comp list suggested adaware spyware removal. i
ran this and haven't had a problem again until today.
the offending program is obviously not in adaware db. (i run adaware with
current ref files every day now).
any suggestions, please,  for removing whatever the f*** is causing this
from my pc?
brian
