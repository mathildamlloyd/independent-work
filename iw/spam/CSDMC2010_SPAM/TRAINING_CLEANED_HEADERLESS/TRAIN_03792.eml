i wouldn't suggest putting any time into engineering a java-specific =
switch which is only going to be used by an audience of developers, who =
can follow steps on a wiki until mozilla is ready to make the switch for =
all of their customers. i think the plan is to just cut over completely =
to plugin2 and drop support for the jep at some point (and we had to =
ship update 2 & 7 with the plugin2 symlink present in /library/internet =
plug-ins to make that a possibility). but really someone from mozilla =
would be best to comment on how and when they are planning to do what.

i don't believe it makes sense for apple to say which plugin "should be =
the default for all browsers". plugin1 is simply the default for safari =
for now (and will likely remain the default forever on leopard). chrome =
never bothered to implement a compatibility hack to load plugin1, and =
simply did without java support until apple shipped an npapi plugin2 =
that could render cooperatively via coregraphics, and didn't use an =
overlay window.

obviously, plugin2 is a continuing work in progress that has several =
more technical challenges ahead (like interleaving hardware accelerated =
drawing), will likely require changes to browsers (like adopting =
coreanimation-npapi drawing model), 3rd party libraries (like jogl), and =
will probably provide a tiered user experience based on which browser =
supports which drawing models, event models, and other features. we are =
also still iterating on the user experience of how to handle applets =
that open their own windows and dialogs that are in a different process =
from the browser.

currently, we don't have any stored setting which tracks the switch =
between plugin1 or plugin2. the state of the java preferences ui is =
actually just built from the presence or non-presence of the =
javaplugincocoa.bundle symlink. in a future release when we make plugin2 =
the default for safari, we'll simply delete the javaplugincocoa.bundle =
in /library/internet plug-ins (which we know mozilla does not use), and =
alter java preferences to write out a symlink to ~/library/internet =
plug-ins instead, so the change is only scoped to the user. at least =
that's the current plan, and it could change, but it's the best idea =
we've got so far.

i hope this provides some perspective on where we'd like to go with =
plugin2,
