hey, look at that!

       dropprivs   if  set  to`yes'  procmail  will drop all privileges
   it might have had (suid or sgid).  this is only
   useful if you want to guarantee that the bottom half
   of  the /etc/procmailrc file is executed on behalf
   of the recipient.

of course, removing setuid/gid bits on programs that don't need it is
always a good idea.  a general rule of system administration: don't give
out permissions unless you absolutely need to.   ;)
