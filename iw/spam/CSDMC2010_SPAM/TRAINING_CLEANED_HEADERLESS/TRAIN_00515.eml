dear all
i need to schedule for a repeated task on my debian server, as the
followings:
-) telnet to a remote node
-) issue a command
-) capture the output in a log
-) logout from telnet
-) wait for a prescribed time interval
-) then redo , but append the subsequent output in just on file
can you please let me know which options do we have to write such a task?
thank you
