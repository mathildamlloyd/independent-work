first, thanks for all the rpms, and especially ogle (which comes very close to 
working perfectly on my cyrix 333 box!).

now, i desperately need some games, especially tuxkart and flightgear, but i 
forever get stuck on a dependency: everything needs opengl. querying the rpm 
database for opengl gets me nowhere fast. can anyone point me in the right 
direction? what, in redhat, provides opengl?

sorry for the question, but i've just switched from suse and i'm used to being 
able to tell yast to sort out the dependencies........

cheers

john
