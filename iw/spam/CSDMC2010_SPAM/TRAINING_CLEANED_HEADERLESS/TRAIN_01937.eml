a screen dream

good mac screensavers are hard to come by. and screensavers are
important: not only do they preserve your screen quality, but
they can also turn your monitor into a conversation piece.
marine aquarium, our pick of the week, will turn your desktop
into a virtual tropical fish aquarium that will make your mac
turn some heads. no need to feed:

awaited first foray into mpeg-4 technology; cartoon editor, a
graphic editor that will help you make quicktime cartoons;
moondock, so you can keep track of moon phases on your desktop;
webdesign, a full-featured html editor with lots of extras; and
sigma chess lite, so you can challenge your mind and develop
your skills at the ancient game of chess.

   cartoon editor
   version: 1.2.1
   file size: 2.38mb
   license: free
   minimum requirements: mac os x

   cartoon editor won't turn you into a gifted cartoonist
   overnight. but what this graphic editor will do is make quick
   work of creating short quicktime movies and animated gifs--
   and for os x freeware, it doesn't get much better than that.
   cartoon editor lets you draw or import jpegs and gifs, which
   you can then manipulate with a set of tools that lets you
   group, scale, duplicate, ghost, and all sorts of other useful
   cartoony things. the program's java2d foundation allows for
   some surprisingly powerful features, like gradients,
   antialiasing, splining, and transparencies.

   get in touch with the natural rhythms of our solar system
   with moondock, a simple piece of software that tracks the

   planet's companion satellite on your desktop. the images are
   high-quality color photos that change over time in accordance
   with the date. moondock includes both astronomical and survey
   data, meaning that you can calculate the appropriate moon
   phase for a particular date and identify topographical
   features on the moon using a built-in catalog of those that
   have been surveyed by astronomers and astronauts. this update
   incorporates improved help features and a few bug fixes.

   with relative ease; and work with a full selection of tools

   localization. webdesign supports both html and xhtml, along

   various browsers, and has more stable editing and ftp tools.
