the email thread below is from fall of 2006.
i don't supposed anyone has any new comments to add to this question?

iremoted is still popular ( http://danbri.org/words/2009/10/18/478 ).   
and the license looks friendly.

also i noticed this:
http://www.martinkahr.com/2007/07/26/remote-control-wrapper-20/index.html

does anyone have any first hand experience with these or other  
possibilities?

regards,
  - jeremy
