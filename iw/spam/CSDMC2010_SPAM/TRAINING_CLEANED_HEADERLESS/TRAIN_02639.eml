i actually thought of this kind of active chat at aol (in 1996 i think), 
bringing up ads based on what was being discussed and other features. 
for a while, the vp of dev. (now still cto i think) was really hot on 
the idea and they discussed patenting it. then they lost interest. 
probably a good thing.

my guess is it's more insidious than that, it's going to be activespam.

"oh, you're going to seattle? i can get you airline tickets for less"
