merrill lynch downgrades yahoo in report 7/11/02 
analysts justin baldauf and tim gernitis cut their intermediate-term rating on the internet giant from "neutral" to "reduce/sell" and their long-term rating from "strong buy" to "neutral" after seeing yahoo's second-quarter results. although the results look solid at first, baldauf and gernitis say yahoo's growth was driven entirely by new initiatives. they also argue the firm's improved outlook seems driven completely by the overture deal extension. eventually, these initiatives will result in much lower growth rates, the analysts say. they argue yahoo's stock price isn't supported by the firm's fundamentals.yahoo inc 12.92 5.99%
