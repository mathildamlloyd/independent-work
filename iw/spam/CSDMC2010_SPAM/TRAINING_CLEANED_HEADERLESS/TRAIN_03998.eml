what seems to work for me (and i agree, it's pretty confusing,
especially when you add 'man grub-set-default' to the mix) is to
include these three lines in menu.lst:

defaultsaved
# updatedefaultentry=true
# savedefault=true

i'm not quite certain which are necessary, but as i've said, this seems
to give me the behavior that i (and, iiuc, you) want.
