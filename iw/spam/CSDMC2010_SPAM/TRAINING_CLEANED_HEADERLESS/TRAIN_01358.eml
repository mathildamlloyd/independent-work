i had this problem with 64-bit ubuntu for a long time. finally, when
adobe was working on the 9.x release i inquired directly to adobe. the
result was that i became a beta tester. and the outcome was that adobe
fixed reader 9.1 so that i could see my printers.

i have not had the problem since. i suggest getting the latest version
of reader. version 8.1.7 is really old anyway.
