hello,

i've been using linux (debian) for about a year now, and although i'm no
longer scared of the command line i would like to do a little
reading/studying of linux to get a better understanding of some of the more
advanced topics, or to see if i have learned a lot of the things that might
be taught in a university-linux/unix course. i'm sure that there is a lot of
stuff that i've missed by just going at it with trial and error. perhaps
there are some online courses posted to youtube, or a few books that someone
might like to recommend? i would be interested to know what types of things
one must learn to get "linux-certification" (i presume there is such a
thing).

regards,
james
