i'm not sure this is the right list to write to... sorry in any case...

i have three different tools (e.g. a, b, c) that use the same package (a 
package i created).
is there a way to put it all in a singe xcode project that creates the 
package, then a.jar, b.jar and finally c.jar?
i tried with multiple targets, but it didn't work (may be i forgot to 
set some options?).

any idea?

many thanks in advance,
best regards,
livio.
