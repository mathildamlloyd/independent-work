at fermi (yes i'm back there; long story), we're buying 4u systems like 
the fiscal year is ending.  we have ~20 asa ir4us1 systems (not pushing 
them, there are some other similar units available), with 60 more on 
order.  they're 2-1/2 tb for $10k, although we add a separate ide or 
scsi system disk, because the 3ware raid controllers can saturate. 
intel sds2 motherboard, 2 1.4ghz p3s, 2 gb ram, 2 3ware 7850 raid 
controllers, 16 160gb maxtors, syskonnect gigabit enet, fermi redhat 7.3.

there's some interesting info at:

http://mit.fnal.gov/~msn/cdf/caf/server_evaluation.html

we've decided to go with xfs (which linus has just merged into the 2.5 
tree), mostly because none of the other journaled fs's can maintain >30 
gb/s rates with a nearly full filesystem (mostly gb files) with random 
deletions (we use these systems for caching our 2 petabyte tape store). 
  ext3 almost did it but dropped from from ~38mb/s to 10 with random 
deletions, and didn't want to do direct io at all.  only concern is an 
occasional system lock-up we haven't chased down yet.  a load avg > 100 
is always a patio of fun.

oddly, even fairly beefy systems like these will breathe hard to keep up 
with the new stk 9940b tape drives, which crank along at a steady 
30gb/s.  and you oldforktimers will remember "doofus" my old file server 
system.  it would only take 2.1" of rackspace now, instead of 14 racks.

cheers,
wayne
