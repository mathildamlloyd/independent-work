hi all,

recently a couple of new machines came to my hands, hp dl 180 g6 with 500gb
sata hard disk, and i tried to setup a 2-nodes ganeti cluster with debian
lenny.

default 2-6-26 kernel does work without any issue.

i've done a fresh installation with nothing more than the basics (vim and
less ;) ) and after a aptitude install ganeti, editing xen-config.xsp and
grub xen options, upon restarting i get the following error on the screen:

apr 15 13:24:56 virt8 kernel: [  297.381987] ata3.00: exception emask 0x0

apr 15 13:24:56 virt8 kernel: [  297.914235] ata3: eh complete

the installed versions are:
linux-image-2.6.26-1-xen-686
xen-hypervisor-3.2-1-i386
ganeti                              1.2.6-3+lenny2
ganeti-instance-debootstrap         0.5-1
drbd8-utils                         2:8.0.14-2+lenny1

i upgraded to kernel 2-6-26-2 to see whether it solved the issue without
success.
i also tried booting with clocksource=acpi_pm. i've also just tried
acpi=off, pci=nosmi, and nocpi as suggests the ata kernel website without
much success.

i've checked through internet and found the following:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=480317

it should be solved because hipervisor version 3.2 is higher than the one
solving the issue (3.0.3) unless redhat's version differ much from the
debian ones in minnor version....which i don't think.


can anyone shed some light on this issue?

thank you in advance!!
