warning: this is a very bad thing to do, and will put your machine into =
an unsupportable configuration!

there is no official way to roll back to the gm version, however the =
installer for 10.6 update 1 is at , =
and the 10.5 update 6 is at .

if you manually modify the bundle version in the =
/system/library/frameworks/javavm.framework/resources/info.plist, the =
installer should install on top of the developer preview, however it =
will not be aware of some of the new content in the dp. this causes some =
tools like java visualvm to fail, because it's bundle will contain a =
hodgepodge of gm and dp bits, and the gm installer doesn't know to =
remove the dp bits (because when it was created, the dp bits we not =
invented yet).

this should be enough to test the 1.6.0_17 jvm, but this is hardly a =
"valid" configuration. installing the 10m3044/9m3144 dp again on top of =
this mixed mess _should_ clean up the gm bits and put you into a valid =
dp configuration. probably. most likely.

if things get too out of control, you should always be able to move =
aside the /system/library/frameworks/javavm.framework/versions =
directory, and re-run either the gm or dp installer, and you should get =
a fully coherent java installation (modulo the tools in /usr/share/java =
and a other few exceptions in /system/library which don't really change =
between versions).

best of luck,
