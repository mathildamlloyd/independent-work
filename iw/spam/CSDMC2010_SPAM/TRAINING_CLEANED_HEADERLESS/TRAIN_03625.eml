hi!

asterisk in debian/lenny claims to be bristuffed, not? at least the
the debian patch tracking system shows the bristuff-patches:

[1] http://bit.ly/brrhe7

we have a quadbri-card and recently needed support from junghanns.net
but they refused telling us there is no bristuff installed because of
the show version output:

*cli> show version
asterisk 1.4.21.2~dfsg-3+lenny1 built by pbuilder @ grnetbox on a  
x86_64 running linux on 2009-12-14 19:04:56 utc

why was the "bristuffed" line removed? debian/etch did have that
postfix.

after telling them debian/lenny is bristuffed they said this
"installation method" is not supported. huh?!
does anyone has a comment on this?

greetings,
 - darsha


p.s.: x-posted to debian-user and asterisk-user list.
