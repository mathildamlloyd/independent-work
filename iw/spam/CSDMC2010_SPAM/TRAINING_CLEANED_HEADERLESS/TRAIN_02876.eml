14  speaking of threats

      i got a facebook alert from a friend the other day, but it
looked a little suspect. it said "look at you in this video, ha, ha!"

in the first place, she would never have written "ha, ha"
-- and the second point, the url lead to an unfamiliar domain.

you did read my alert piece above, right? so, i immediately wrote
her at her email address and alerted her that the facebook
account had been compromised. a day later she wrote:

   > i have been told by our is department that this is a
   >  very bad worm.  if you were also hijacked be sure to monitor
   >  your credit card and banking accounts regularly.
   >  never click on any links in the future.  this has been a
   >  vicious attack and they had to go back two weeks on my
   > work pc and we still found at least 6 objects (worm.koobface)
   > through malwarebytes and sybot scans.

need i say more?
