the thing i miss most in kde4 is: pausing the cursor over a music
file in konq (file manager, icon view) and hearing the contents.
this was such an awesome feature that microsoft has copied it for
windows 7; and it's disappeared from konq/dolphin. i asked about it
once, and got  back.

otherwise, i'm a happy kde4.4 user (on a number of distros).

any chance?
