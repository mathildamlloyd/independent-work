i've had this binding in my ~/.exmh/exmhbindings for years:

set {bindings(key,flist_findunseen 1 ; inc_presortfinish)} 

after updating to the current code in cvs i get "bad key f" when 
i hit the "f" key.  i can open the bindings... commands window 
and define the binding.  it then works until i restart exmh.

i suspect a parsing problem/change.  i'll try to look into this 
tomorrow unless someone knows where the problem might be.
