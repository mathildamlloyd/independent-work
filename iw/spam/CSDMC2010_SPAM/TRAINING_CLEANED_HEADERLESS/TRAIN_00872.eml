sometimes i'll get "mount: no medium found on /dev/sr0" or it will mount, or
it will give me the other error message i posted.

i just put a disc in, tried to mount it three times, and got three different
results. now it is mounted and /dev looks like
http://paste.debian.net/73572/

now i've taken the disc out and dev looks like:
http://paste.debian.net/73573/

they look the same to me.
