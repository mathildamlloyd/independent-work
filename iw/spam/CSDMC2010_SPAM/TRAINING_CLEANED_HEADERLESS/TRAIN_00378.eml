i create my pdfs (required for reports and specs) with openoffice 

no, not the pdf stuff is  but ooo which is  crap.  switching  from
m$ office to openoffice let you  increase  the  psy-bill  more,  than  a
dedicated computer with m$ viasco plus adobe acrobat will cost.  even if
you only create pdfs with it.

thanks, greetings and nice day/evening
