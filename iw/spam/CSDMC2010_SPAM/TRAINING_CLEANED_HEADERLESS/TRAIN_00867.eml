i installed 10m3050 and it looks like overall a big improvement.  in 
particlar, the rendering errors i've seen are gone.  however, i have 
noticed one new problem which i don't think was present in the previous 
version of the plugin.  i can't (mouse) drag inside an applet in firefox. 
dragging works in safari.  if i open

http://pivot.apache.org/demos/decorators.html

i can't move the "window" by dragging the title bar.  also, if i open

http://pivot.apache.org/demos/itunes-search.html

and search for "beethoven" i cannot drag the scrollbar.  do you have the 
same problem?

cheers,

michael
