liberalism
propagandized as meddling
in truth, the middle

"american liberalism believes that in this respect it has made a major
contribution to the grand strategy of freedom. where both capitalists and
socialists in the 1930's were trying to narrow the choice to either/or --
either laissez-faire capitalism or bureaucratic socialism -- the new deal
persisted in its vigorous faith that human intelligence and social
experiment could work out a stable foundation for freedom in a context of
security and for security in a context of freedom. that faith remains the
best hope of free society today."

fluid yet crunchy,
