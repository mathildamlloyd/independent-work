hi,

i'm no longer able to play encrypted dvd's using the xine rpm from freshrpms. 
i think it was about a week ago when i last rented some dvd's, worked just 
fine, but apparently since the latest xine update on freshrpms, it won't 
anymore. 
the output is :

input_dvd: sorry, this plugin doesn't play encrypted dvds. the legal status
           of css decryption is unclear and we can't provide such code.
           please check http://dvd.sf.net for more information.

i'm pretty sure it worked with the previous freshrpms release... any way of 
rolling back updates ?
