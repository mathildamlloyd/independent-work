nice trick.

one thing - to save an image as an animated gif (for example),
you just do a save as, and set the extension to .gif - you should
get a dialog asking whether you want to merge visible layers or
save as an animation. i believe that you can also specify the
extension as .mpg or .mpeg if you've got the mpeg plug-in built.
