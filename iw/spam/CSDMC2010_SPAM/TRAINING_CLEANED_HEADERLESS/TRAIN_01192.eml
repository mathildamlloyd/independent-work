 this is a pain. 

 the only way you can resolve this, to my knowledge is to download the
original libvorbis rpm and the new one. remove the old one, then do:

 rpm -uvh libvorbis-*

 rpm then assumes that you want both versions installed at the same time,
and does so. why you can't do this after you have one library already
installed is beyond me.
