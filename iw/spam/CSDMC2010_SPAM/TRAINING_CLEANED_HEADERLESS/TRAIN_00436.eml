the fact is that i didn't perform any pasting: even running "gpg
--verify" directly on the message file fails (sylpheed stores e-mail
messages in mh format, hence each message is on a separate file).

i received the message encoded as quoted-printable: maybe something in
the middle performed some re-encoding, that broke the signature?

however, that does not explain why mutt is able to correctly verify
the signature...
damn mutt, always one step beyond!  ;-)

wouldn't we be better off using pgp/mime signed messages (rfc 2015)
in order to avoid encoding issues?
as far as i've heard, clear-signed e-mail messages are deprecated precisely
because of this kind of signature breakages, due to possible re-encoding.

any thoughts?
