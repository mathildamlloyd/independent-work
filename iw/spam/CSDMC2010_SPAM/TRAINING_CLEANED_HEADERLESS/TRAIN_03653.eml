google pr sends a message that they have a new news service[1]. maybe i'm slow 
this morning, or maybe i'm spoiled, but what's the big deal. i thought they 
already had this. my personal aggregator[2] is better, it shows me what i'm 
interested in, it's not one size fits all. help me figure this out. i'm sure 
there's something innovative here, i just don't see it.
