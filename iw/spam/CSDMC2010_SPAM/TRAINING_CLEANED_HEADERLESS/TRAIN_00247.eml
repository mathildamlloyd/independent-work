well: thats what i mean. do you *understand* whats going on there?

i am a linux trainer, consultant and administrator since >5 years and=20
still don't get *why* this happen and *what* it triggers. i might get it=20
when i study mysql, dbus, resource agents, nepomuk, *whatever* else it=20
uses - but i am and i want to be *just a user* of this stuff.=20

so i think this is for upstream to solve - and if it ain't work reliably=20
in kde 4.4 i think it has to be fixed within kde 4.4 series. akonadi might=
=20
use mysql or not, but it if uses it, kaddressbook should still just work=20
*predictably*.

thus i suggest reporting anything like that upstream - especially to you,=20
boyd - complaining here probably just won't help. and if upstream does not=
=20
get bug reports they probably don't even know that something is broken on=20
probably only *some* systems.

some issues might be packaging related, but then i hope to get hints back=20
from upstream developers so that i can file debian bug reports with proper=
=20
suggestions. until then i think i default to reporting upstream, unless=20
someone convinces me to do elsewise.

ciao,
