i was sufficiently intrigued by the (apparent) absence of a simple mta
that does the above, so i decided to write my own: tmta.  it actually
works, and is documented, although it's still pretty much in the
proof-of-concept stage:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/tmta/

one important thing that it does *not* (yet?) do is fork; it's currently
implemented as a basic, single-threaded daemon, so it can only accept
one connection at a time.  it shouldn't be too difficult (famous last
words ...) to convert into a multi-threaded model, although i have no
experience with that sort of thing.

it is still small, though - under 70 lines of actual perl code,
although it does, of course, require the basic perl installation and
about a half-dozen other modules.

if anyone has any feedback, or suggestions for improvement, i'd love
to hear them.
