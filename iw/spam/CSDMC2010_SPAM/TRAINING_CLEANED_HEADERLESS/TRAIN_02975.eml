the aptitude search ~aunstable appears to just list all the packages in the
repository. as so with the other commands. the list of packages is so long
that gmail freezes when i try to past it in, and paste.debian.net tells me

 =a0that's the problem -- you have no (active) "deb" li=
nes for unstable,
so apt doesn't know which packages are from it.
