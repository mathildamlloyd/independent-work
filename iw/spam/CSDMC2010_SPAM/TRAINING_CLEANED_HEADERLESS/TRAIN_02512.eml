hi goran,

i just posted a followup with my complaint on the mc user list:
http://mail.gnome.org/archives/mc/2010-april/msg00024.html

it's not that simple as i mention there: when you change that default 
option all the directory entries turn bright white and in mcedit the 
entries turn black on white with a blue background which looks ridiculous.

the problem is that they changed a major function without fallback and 
without a spectrum of options.

too bad but it's waiting until skins get developed or pinning mc to 
prevent 4.7.0.1 from installing.
