the buzz about the upcoming movie

people are already talking about the sensitive subject of kids and drug addiction featured in "the secret life of zoey."
lifetimetv.com community member belfast belle writes:
"my belief is that i started using drugs to fit in and to cope with things that happened to me. my mom died when i was 10. i had to live away from my dad and brothers. where i grew up i was sexually abused for years, but i didn't dare tell anyone. when i finally went to live with my dad and brothers, i had no self-esteem left. i experienced so much shame, and in my mind it seemed as if everyone knew what happened. drugs helped me to feel ok and like i was a part of something. when my dad died, i was devastated. it threw me into a full-blown addiction. my drug use landed me in rehab, in debt and in strained relationships with my brothers. thanks to the help of narcotics anonymous, i have been clean since december 28, 1991. i now have great relationships with my siblings. i love them more than they will ever know. i also have a beautiful seven-year-old daughter who has never seen her mother touch drugs. i don't have any desire to use, either -- just the desire to be the best pe
 rson i can be."
