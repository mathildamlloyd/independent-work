lets say we have an nfs server with nfsd running really high load. nfsstat
will tell you roughly how much traffic is going through with access,
getattr with either client or server but it won't tell you who is doing
it. is there any way on server side to determine what client is causing
the most usage, and on the client side, is there a way to determine which
process?
