hi!

i was toying around with getconf and was looking for options to print
all configuration values. i've found there is a -a option for that. you
can find about it by running getconf with no arguments:

---
razvan@valhalla:~$ getconf
usage: getconf [-v specification] variable_name [pathname]
       getconf -a [pathname]
---

however, the option is not printed when using the --help option:
---
razvan@valhalla:~$ getconf --help
usage: getconf [-v spec] var
  or:  getconf [-v spec] path_var path

get the configuration value for variable var, or for variable path_var
for path path.  if spec is given, give values for compilation
environment spec.

for bug reporting instructions, please see:
.
---

moreover, there is no documentation in the manual page about the -a
option. should this be corrected? should i submit a feature request/bug
report on this issue?
