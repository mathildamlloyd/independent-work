i'm looking for a way to play *.3gp audio files from the command line.
mplayer doesn't seem to work:

    % mplayer some-audio-file.3gp
    [...]
    playing some-audio-file.3gp.
    libavformat file format detected.
    [lavf] audio stream found, -aid 0
    ==========================================================================
    opening audio decoder: [ffmpeg] ffmpeg/libavcodec audio decoders
    cannot find codec 'libamr_nb' in libavcodec...
    adecoder init failed :(
    adecoder init failed :(
    cannot find codec for audio format 0x726d6173.
    read docs/html/en/codecs.html!
    audio: no sound
    video: no video

any suggestions for alternate approaches, pointers on how & what to
install in terms of a codec, or maybe a way to convert these files
(ideally without transcoding degradation)?

these audio files were created by the android app "voice recorder".

tia for any help,

john
