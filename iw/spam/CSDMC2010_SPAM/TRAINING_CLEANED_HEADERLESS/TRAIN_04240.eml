 ah, you see - cobalt's don't use lilo. they have an openboot-like prom
that looks in an ext2 partition in /dev/hda1 for a file called
/boot/vmlinux.gz - nothing else.

 the only way i think you can set parameters is with a "set_params" line.

 however, when i run 
    set_params root=/dev/hda2
 and then run:
    bfd /boot/vmlinux.gz

 it boots the old kernel, i assume from the prom. it seems to do this, if
something goes wrong - no error, just boots the default kernel.

 btw, 'bfd' means 'boot from disk'.
