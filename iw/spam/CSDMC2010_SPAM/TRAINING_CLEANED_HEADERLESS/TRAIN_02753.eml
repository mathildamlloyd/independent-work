the "best" way to acheive this would be to use lvm above your software
raid. at that point, it would be very painless, compared to what is
ahead of you now. if you're curious, here would be the steps:

mdadm -c /dev/md0 -n 2 -l 1 -a yes /dev/sd{a,b}
pvcreate /dev/md0
vgcreate home /dev/md0
lvcreate -l 1g -n swap home
lvcreate -l 10g -n root home
lvcreate -l 100%free -n home home

then, for giving more space to home, and less to root, boot off a live
cd, and (assuming you're using ext3/4):

e2fsck /dev/home/root
resize2fs /dev/home/root 6g
lvreduce -l 6g /dev/home/root
lvextend -l +4g /dev/home/home
resize2fs /dev/home/home

that's it! however, because you chose not to use lvm, you will need to
boot of a live cd that supports linux software raid, rebuild the array,
and perform the resizing there. i'm not sure if gparted supports this or
not. worth checking out, however.

i would personally recommend backing up your data, and reinstalling,
with lvm on top of your software raid. you still have the redundancy,
and you have the awesome flexibility of resizing volumes with great ease.=
