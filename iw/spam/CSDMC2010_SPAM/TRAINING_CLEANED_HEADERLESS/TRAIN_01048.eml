yes an error occurs.
/users/sam/crap2/desktop/memorizeasy/derby.properties (no such file or
directory).

it's a correct error too. using the install dialog i tried to make
folder ~/desktop/crap2, but maybe messed up (that dialog is horrid)
because it's actually created a folder ~/crap2. which is empty, and note
this isn't ~/crap2/desktop as in the error message above. so it's
looking in the wrong place.

by the way that install dialog is really horrible. :) especially that
you're just thrown into it. i hope you can remove the install process.
you could make it into a .dmg-distributed .app-bundle for mac users
instead of webstart at all, which would be nice.

webstart can be ok too, but please make it really be webstart, ie let
java manage where the program files are stored. either way, there's no
need to make users select a folder for user data either - you can
automatically store any user data files somewhere reasonable like
~/library/application support/yourapp on mac, the equivalent application
data folder on windows, and ~/.appname on other platforms.

either 'normal webstart' or '.app bundle in dmg' would give you an app
that requires no configuration or installation process, making it much
easier/less scary for users to install and try out your app. would
probably also sidestep this platform bug (?). :)

--sam

ps if it wasn't clear, i haven't installed the developer preview yet, so
still on 1.6.0_17... really need to do that soon.
