yes, i am sure of that.
i printed all the steps on the output to check:

# create stream=20
## schedule stream=20
### start stream=20
[stuff happens]
#### stop stream=20
##### invalidate stream=20
###### release stream=20
# create stream=20
## schedule stream=20
### start stream=20
[...]
#### stop stream=20
##### invalidate stream=20
###### release stream=20

i don't unschedule the stream from the run loop since i invalidate it.

>=20


all the stream related stuff is happening on the same thread (at least for =
now).
plus, in my example, i don't create a new stream after deleting the first o=
ne (since i have nothing left to watch).

it seems to me the stream may not be properly closed, or it is trying to ac=
cess something that doesn't exist anymore.
but i am following all the steps for properly stopping and releasing the st=
ream.
