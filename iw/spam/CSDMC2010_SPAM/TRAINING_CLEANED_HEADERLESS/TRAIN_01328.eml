        ok, i'm stumped.  i was having some problems which were likely related
to the old kernel in debian "lenny", so i upgraded to "squeeze" in
order to alleviate the issue, which it apparently has.  now, however, i
need to fsck the main array on the box, which is formatted as xfs.  the
xfs-repair utility is not on the upgraded system.  (i was forced to do
a fresh install of the boot drive.)  how can i obtain the xfs file
utilities - particularly xfs-repair - under "squeeze"?
