the documentation isn't clear, will qtvisualcontextcopyimagefortime() =
block or just return nil if the data isn't there yet.

i'm iterating a movie frame by frame from a secondary thread. rather =
than polling/spinning on qtvisualcontextisnewimageavailable() for each =
frame, can i just copyimagefortime() and let it block until the data is =
available? the alternative is to install a hook via =
qtvisualcontextsetimageavailablecallback() and trigger a semaphore, but =
blocking on the copy call would be much more straightforward.

thanks!
