mac fans flocked to the macworld expo in new york to watch apple compute=
r trot out new hardware, software and even a web services plan--but it migh=
t be a challenge getting people to pay for the offerings.


apple ceo steve jobs kicked off the trade show by unveiling new=
 ipod digital-audio players and a new flat-panel imac.

the new ipod players include models built specifically for computers that u=
se microsoft's windows operating system. apple lowered the price of the exi=
sting 5gb ipod and a redesigned 10gb model, which is thinner and comes with=
 a new case and remote control. jobs also introduced a beefier 20gb ipod fo=
r $499. the ipod stable now includes three models for mac users and three m=
odels for windows users with musicmatch software.

as expected, jobs introduced a new imac model with a 17-inch flat-panel mon=
itor. the model offers a widescreen display with 1,440-by-900-pixel resolut=
ion versus 1,024-by-768-pixel resolution for the 15-inch imac.

jobs also previewed the next version of mac os x, version 10.2, which will =
be on store shelves aug. 24 for $129. os x 10.2 includes a new finder with =
improved search features, spring-loaded folders and the ability to change t=
he background photo as often as every 5 seconds.

but fans who rushed to os x last year learned there's no such thing as a ch=
eap upgrade when the company announced it will not offer a disc=
ounted upgrade version of mac os x version 10.2, code-named jaguar, to curr=
ent users of the operating system. to get jaguar, current os x users will h=
ave to buy a new macintosh or an entirely new version of the operating syst=
em for the retail price of $129.

apple's decision not to sell a less-expensive upgrade version lay in the qu=
alitative difference between version 10.1 and 10.2. although the versions s=
hare the same core technology, jaguar includes several new features and ser=
vices, such as search tool sherlock 3 and internet address finder rendezvou=
s, which arguably classify it as an entirely new piece of software.

apple also raised eyebrows by transitioning its itools web serv=
ices from a free program to a paid program called .mac. the company plans t=
o charge about $100 per year for the program. the collection of web service=
s was launched about three years ago, and now includes online storage via a=
 service called idisk, online greeting cards through icards and other featu=
res.

despite itool's popularity, the company may face a tough sell w=
ith the .mac program. the history of paid services, is not a pretty picture=
. customers have bristled when companies try to slap charges on previously =
free services. some have succeeded but many have struggled, especially when=
 free alternatives lurked elsewhere. in the early 1990s, apple's efforts to=
 form online communities and popularize search engines failed magnificently=
.

to its advantage, apple has presented a fairly coherent and tangible set of=
 services with .mac. and although its software division is far more organiz=
ed than it once was, it's unclear how overwhelming demand will be. however,=
 an online petition protesting the new charges doesn't bode wel=
l for the program.

microsoft's moves
not one to be caught in anyone's shadow, microsoft plans to offer a=
 rebate for its office suite for mac os x to those who buy the software=
 bundle when they pick up a new mac. the promotion entails a $50 mail-in re=
bate for people buying a new mac and upgrading to office v. x, and $100 for=
 those buying a mac and the full version of the software.

the offers come after microsoft revealed that sales of the software have no=
t met its expectations. the software potentate had expected to sell 750,000=
 copies of office v. x by now, but instead has sold only 300,000 since the =
program went on sale last november.

microsoft is also putting the finishing touches on the third co=
llection of windows 2000 bug fixes, which is nearly ready for release after=
 a protracted period of testing. the update, windows 2000 service pack 3, c=
ontains vital security updates and hundreds of fixes to bugs plaguing the o=
perating system that microsoft released in february 2000. service pack 3 co=
uld be important for many businesses, as not all of the included security f=
ixes are available as separate downloads.


not everything will be available as a download, however. weeks before micro=
soft plans to reinstate java in windows xp, it has shut down a =
site that would automatically send its java software to windows xp users. t=
he company closed the install-on-demand feature 30 days after it told java =
inventor sun microsystems it would reinstate java in windows xp through the=
 forthcoming service pack 1 but remove it altogether in 2004.

somebody's watching you

you better watch what you write in yahoo's free e-mail service--because yah=
oo is. to protect users from malicious code, yahoo uses an automated filter=
 to swap out a handful of words such as "mocha" and "eval" that=
 pertain to web code known as javascript.

the reason is that e-mail sent in a form known as "web enhanced" can contai=
n javascript instructions able to run programs on the recipient's pc. javas=
cript is a web language that can issue commands such as telling the browser=
 to open up other windows or to prompt a service to change a password, for =
example.

"mocha" is one of those special commands that can be run from web-enhanced =
e-mail. typing "mocha:" into the location bar of the netscape browser will =
open a screen with a display area and a text box underneath, in which comma=
nds can be entered. a malicious hacker could, for example, use the command =
line to run a program that changes a person's password without that person'=
s knowledge.


on the heels of plans for new powers to patrol people's web use, the u.s. g=
overnment is again turning to technology to monitor suspicious acti=
vity in the name of fighting terrorism. the government has unveiled mor=
e details of its terrorist information and prevention system (tips), a plan=
 to recruit volunteers across the country who will keep tabs on dubious or =
suspicious behavior.

"the program will involve the millions of american workers who, in the dail=
y course of their work, are in a unique position to see potentially unusual=
 or suspicious activity in public places," according to the tips web site. =
but the american civil liberties union, one of several critics of the plan,=
 fears the proposal will encourage racial profiling and vigilantism, possib=
ly leading to searches of private homes without a warrant.
