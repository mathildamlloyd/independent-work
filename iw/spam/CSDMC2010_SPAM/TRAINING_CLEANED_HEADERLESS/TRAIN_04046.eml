sharp's zaurus pda suffers security holes

sharp's linux-based, business-oriented zaurus handheld suffers from security holes that could let hackers grab private data off a corporate network, according to researchers at syracuse university.
in an advisory posted wednesday to a syracuse university computer-science web site, researchers said they had found vulnerabilities in sharp's zaurus sl-5500 and zaurus sl-5000d handhelds. the flaws let attackers take control of the device's file system, giving them the power to overwrite files or lock the device so no data can be input through the keypad or touch screen.

outlook plug-in could let the hackers in

a widely used plug-in for microsoft's outlook e-mail client that lets users encrypt and digitally sign messages has inadvertently weakened security and left the mail program open to attack.
security company eeye digital security issued a warning late wednesday to users of network associates' pretty good privacy (pgp) plug-in for outlook, saying that a vulnerability in the add-on could let attackers execute malicious software on a victim's computer. network associates released a patch for the problem wednesday as well.

aclu: don't rat out your customers

a clutch of civil liberties groups is asking small internet service providers to get a backbone and stand up to companies seeking to unveil anonymous critics.
a group including the electronic frontier foundation, the american civil liberties union (aclu), and the center for democracy and technology is urging isps to alert customers when they are the targets of so-called john doe legal actions, which try to unmask the identities of people who anonymously air their companies' dirty laundry. the group has sent letters to more than 100 isps, asking them to adopt a written policy promising to let customers know if they're targets.

shareholders sue paypal, ebay

the paypal-ebay merger has hit an early snag: two shareholder lawsuits have been filed against the companies seeking to block the deal.
the lawsuits, each filed in delaware chancery court earlier this week on behalf of paypal shareholders, charge that the deal represents a breach of the companies' fiduciary duty to those shareholders and that the price ebay is paying for paypal is unfair and inadequate, the companies said in separate regulatory filings on thursday.
