i'm developing a qt app on windows, and am using a wsh javascript to =
control output from the application. i have everything working, except i =
want to make a track blend 50% with the background and it just doesn't =
seem to work. here is what i'm using:

qttargetmovie.qtcontrol.movie.tracks(3).top =3d =
qttargetmovie.qtcontrol.movie.height-qttargetmovie.qtcontrol.movie.tracks(=
3).height;
qttargetmovie.qtcontrol.movie.tracks(3).transfermode =3d =
qttransfermodesenum.qttransfermodeblend;
qttargetmovie.qtcontrol.movie.tracks(3).operationcolor =3d =
"32768,32768,32768";
qttargetmovie.qtcontrol.movie.tracks(3).highqualitymode =3d true;

the first line is changing the location of the track, which it does just =
fine, so i know i have the right track addressed. the next line just =
doesn't seem to happen. the track is always set to dither when i check =
the movie properties. i am using version 7.6.6 of qt on windows.

i also tried:

qttargetmovie.qtcontrol.movie.tracks(3).transfermode =3d =
qttransfermodesenum.qttransfermodestraighalphablend;

i'm using the book "quicktime for .net and com developers" by john =
cromie as my reference (which is excellent, btw).
