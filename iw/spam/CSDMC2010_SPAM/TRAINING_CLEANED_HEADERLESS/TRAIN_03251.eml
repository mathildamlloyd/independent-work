and i claim he would be better off using a card that doesn't use firmware[1=
]=20
or uses free firmware, since non-free firmware is an issue for distributors=
=20
and it's relatively easy to "accidentally" participate in distributing=20
software in violation of its license.

i wouldn't want to be stuck without non-free available, but i recommend mak=
ing=20
hardware purchases that allow you to avoid non-free as much as possible.  i=
'm=20
gradually moving that way myself.  (desktop and laptop each need one driver=
=20
from non-free.)

once you've got the hardware, you might as well use it, even if it requires=
=20
non-free drivers.  the manufacturer has already got their cut of what you=20
paid; you are hurting none but yourself by not using it.  you should try an=
d=20
avoid becoming dependent on that hardware, since that makes you dependent o=
n=20
non-free software.

[1] "firmware" here is specifically limited to executable data transmitted =
to=20
the device from a host operating system, and does not include executable da=
ta=20
loaded from an eeprom (or similar) that is provided with the device.
