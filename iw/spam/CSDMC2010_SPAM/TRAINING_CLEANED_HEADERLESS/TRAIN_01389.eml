back when i had regular rh7.3 there was nothing better than "apt-get upgrade". but
now i'm running (null) beta and i have these questions:

which version of "apt" can i use, the rh7.3 version or the "rawhide" version?

is there a way to use apt to update (null) with the rpms available for (null)
through up2date, since i prefer apt to that?

if i can use apt, can i use it to get updates from these 3 different places:
1. the (null) up2date redhat upgrades
2. the (null) files at freshrpms.net
3. the regular rh7.3 files from freshrpms.net

am i asking for too much simplicity in this complicated world?

that's "angle" as in geometry.
