do i need to do anything to recreate anything after deleting this?

i did notice an rpm i made the other day didn't work, and just sat there 
for ages  seemingly doing nothing, which probably did this :(

ok, now i get:


fetched 88.1kb in 2m31s (581b/s)
error: cannot get exclusive lock on /var/lib/rpm/packages
error: cannot open packages index using db3 - operation not permitted (1)
e: could not open rpm database:cannot open packages index using db3 - 
operation not permitted (1)

arrrrg.
