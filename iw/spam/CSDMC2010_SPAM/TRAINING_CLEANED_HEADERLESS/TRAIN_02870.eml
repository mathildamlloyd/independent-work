hi !

i'm getting some problems with xquartz (2.5.0). i'm running on mac os =
10.6.3. my problem is the following :

i use the option of the terminal to automatically launch xquartz when =
launching terminal. it works well, and xquartz is launched. i can then =
launch applications which need x11, like nedit.

after working, i close all the open x11 windows, i close xquartz and =
terminal with "command-q" keys.
the problems appear here : if i want to relaunch nedit, doing exactly =
the same procedure, i obtain the "can't open display" exit status for =
nedit. however, xquartz is normally launched.

i don't understand this behaviour. somebody has an idea ? probably a =
problem with the environment variables ?

thank you !
