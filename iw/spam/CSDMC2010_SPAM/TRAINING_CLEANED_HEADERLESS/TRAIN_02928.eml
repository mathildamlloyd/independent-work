the unexpected forced downgrade from kde 3.5 to 4 in sid actually
ended up being a good thing for me. (the loss of the ability to have a
different background for each desktop was a kde showstopper.  so the
forced downgrade prompted me to actually take a serious look at other
desktop environments.   and had that not happened, i would not be
using enlightenment on all my linux boxes today.  i have become quite
enamored with enlightenment, and now see no need whatsoever to go back
to kde or switch to gnome.

granted, i will happily use various kde and gnome based tools if
needed.  that is no big deal.  but e (with the steampunk theme)  is
now my environment of choice.  :)  only drawback so far i have
encountered is the inability to change the background color on the
desktop if the wallpaper image does not fill the entire screen.  it
can be a bit hard on the eyes with that harsh white background, but i
think i can get used to it.
