hi,

succeeded in ringing a bell anytime i get a mail
to my inbox (not mailing lists, spams etc.) by
using procmail to execute a "play clink.wav" on
the "right" mails.
now my demands are growing ;-)
i use my laptop remotely very often and now i would
like the bell to sound on that when i am there.
i triedto use the kde remote sound server and it works in
the tests, but when procmail runs it it doesn't, presumably
as it doesn't have the authorization to communicate with
the laptop, beeing another user?

any hints.

brgds
