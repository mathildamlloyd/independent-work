my girlfriend's dell mini's screen got cracked on a recent trip even though
we had it in a protective case and now the netbook is useless, because to
replace one of those screens basically requires taking the entire machine
apart and it's out of warranty.  my 6 year old dell latitude d800 on the
other hand, while weighing in about 3 times as much, is solid as a brick and
the screen has no flex.  after the dell mini lasted only 8 months, we've
decided no more netbooks.  but that's just our experience, i know netbooks
work well for some people.   i question their durability for using while
travelling though, which is kinda the whole point of the netbooks...
