i recently cleaned my spam corpus from them but these are my current 
results:
   overall        spam     nonspam  name
     13929         995       12934  (all messages)
        13          13           0  t_trafficmagnet

i put it into cvs_rules_under_test, let's see what the 2.41 ga run thinks 
about it :)
