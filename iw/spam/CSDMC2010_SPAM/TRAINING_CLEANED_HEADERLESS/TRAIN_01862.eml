hi,

i receive the message `battery is now fully charged' on my asus eee
1000he under debian lenny 5 w. kernel 2.26-2-686, but only once i have
unplugged the cable? for example, the pc might be on ac power for 15
hours, and say nothing. if i then unplug the cable, it tells me that the
battery is _now_ fully charged. is it normal? does someone else
experience this?

thanks,
