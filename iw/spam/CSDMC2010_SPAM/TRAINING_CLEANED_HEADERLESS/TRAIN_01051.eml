i'm curious.  when i install mysql on a lenny server it thereafter
automatically starts the global /var/lib/mysql mysql server at boot time.

i thought akonadi was intended to use a private mysql server process
running in each users' home directory and started as needed.  (maybe
i misunderstood.)

does installing kde cause a global /var/lib/mysql mysql server to run on
each workstation, even when nobody is logged in?
