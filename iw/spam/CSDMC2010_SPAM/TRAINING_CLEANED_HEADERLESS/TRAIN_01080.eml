it looks like you're running via procmail -- what are the permissions
on procmail?  "insecure dependency" screams "i'm in taint mode!", which
is a typical problem when procmail is setuid/setgid (the permissions
should be 755).

if this is in fact the problem, an easy solution is to put "dropprivs=yes"
in the procmailrc. :)
