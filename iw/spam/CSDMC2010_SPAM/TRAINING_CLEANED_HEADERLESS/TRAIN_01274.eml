i think there may be some confusion here, mr. krafft.  the comments
i made above were not in reference to anything _you_ wrote.  they were
in reference to the original edition of "the linux cookbook", by
michael stutz, which was copyrighted in 2001.

i suggest that you go back and look more closely at my original post.
