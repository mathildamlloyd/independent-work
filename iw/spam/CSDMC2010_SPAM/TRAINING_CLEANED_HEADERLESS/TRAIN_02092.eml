do you really think this is true?  i added a modify time check thinking that 
it would make an improvement since we were reading it a *lot* more times in 
the new code because we're trying to use the sequences.

on the other hand, the sequences files are probably being read out of cache 
when that happens anyway.

even with a small file, i'd think that the time taken to do a 
[file mtime $filename] would be worth it.  my code is in proc mhreadseqs.
