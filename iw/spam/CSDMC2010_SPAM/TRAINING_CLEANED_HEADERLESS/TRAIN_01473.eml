which version of kde, 3.x or 4.x? (i don't remember a task bar applet
for mounting removable media from my kde 3.x days - i always triggered
mounting via the icons that appeared on the desktop for removable media
- but i might simply not know about alternatives.)

mounting worked for you earlier, so i assume that your users are all
members of the "plugdev" group already. i would like to see the output
of:

  awk '//,/<\/policy>/' /etc/dbus-1/system.d/hal.conf

it would be interesting to know if regular users can mount usb sticks
using pmount or pmount-hal on the command line.

afaik, you should not have any entries in fstab for removable devices
that you want to be handled by kde/gnome/whatever_other_de via the
dbus/hal mechanism. in any case, i would avoid trying to mix different
approaches.

i have seen that complaint before, also for systems on which mounting
worked perfectly for single-user sessions, and i am not sure if a
satisfactory solution exists. (i have no need for running multiple kde
sessions on the same machine, therefore i do not know much about this
issue.)

well, it is a problem for you right now, so why not try to solve it?
besides, udisks has the same main developer as hal, so i doubt that it
will be so radically different that hal know-how will become useless. i
have played around a bit with udisks yesterday, it seems to follow the
same basic concepts as hal. afaict, udisks-daemon is simply an upgraded
version of hald that is specialized on block devices, as one part of a
more modular approach to hardware abstraction.
