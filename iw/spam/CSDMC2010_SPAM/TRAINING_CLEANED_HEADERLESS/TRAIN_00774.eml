has anyone tried it with the 10m3050 or 9m3150 developer preview? i'm =
somewhat concerned that this is a demonstrable regression between java 5 =
and java 6 - however there are several other factors that can impact =
memory use:

- 32 vs. 64-bit (biggest culprit)
- 1.5/client/32-bit tuned garbage collection options running on =
1.6/server/64-bit
- client vs. server hotspot itself (more aggressive compilation and =
storage of compiled code)

anecdotally, i've talked to several people who have large long running =
64-bit processes on snow leopard with 2gb-of-ram machines who were =
having a miserable time. while reverting to 32-bit may be a quick fix =
for some, others who tuned the gc parameters or turned on =
-xx:+usecompressedoops (which compresses java references to 32-bit =
values in the heap) found that they could reclaim or even exceed their =
original 32-bit performance (since they were still using the server =
jvm).

since someone mentioned that netbeans 6.9 beta was working well, i'd =
suggest taking a look at it's jvm options and see if there wasn't some =
tweaking done to optimize it for a 64-bit by default world.

best of luck,
