 ah, they told me that about my a1200. just got a video box, cut air holes
and a hole for the cables, then got an extra-long 2.5" to 3.5" ide cable,
and connected it up. had to make a few holes in the a1200 case for the
ide cable too.

 worked a charm. until i dropped the disk one day onto concrete.
