if you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product using a 1-800 toll-free access number, your service will be operating within 1-2 work days.

please try dialing 1-866-865-4548.

in either case, when your service is switched on, you will hear a voice ask you to dial the number you are calling.

you must dial 1+area code+7 digit number followed by # to make any calls: local or long distance.
