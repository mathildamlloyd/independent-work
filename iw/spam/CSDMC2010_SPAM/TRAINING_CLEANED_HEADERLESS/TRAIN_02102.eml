i've got a java application that contains a -panel within a frame and
i want to draw into the panel and the method works on windows (with os
specific modification).
however, when i execute the program on a mac it would appear that
nsview *view = dsi_mac->cocoaviewref; returns the parent window, which
in this case is the frame.

is there anyway i can modify the code below to ensure that i always
have the panel as my windows context rather the frame?

        // get the corresponding peer from the caller canvas
        nsview *view = dsi_mac->cocoaviewref;
        
        nswindow *window = [view window];
        nsgraphicscontext *ctxt = [nsgraphicscontext
graphicscontextwithwindow:window];
        cgcontextref cg = [ctxt graphicsport];
