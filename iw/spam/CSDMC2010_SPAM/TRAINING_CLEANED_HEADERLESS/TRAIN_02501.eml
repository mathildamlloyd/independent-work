this update appears to have broken the sunpkcs11 provider... sort of.

attempting to use an alternate pkcs11 provider while the one while

security.provider.1=3dsun.security.pkcs11.sunpkcs11 =
${java.home}/lib/security/sunpkcs11-macosx.cfg

is present in java.security results in things like this (an example from =
jarsigner):

jarsigner error: java.security.invalidkeyexception: private keys must be =
instance of rsaprivate(crt)key or have pkcs#8 encoding

replacing security.provider.1 with an instance of bouncycastle (or =
removing it and renumbering all of the other entries) is a work-around.
