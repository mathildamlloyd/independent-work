hi carlos miranda molina, please work on your message trimming 
technique, the op was already hinted toward non-free by camalen earlier 
in this thread so i could only assume he was aware of the need to use 
non-free. i just mentioned that for me fglrx from sid is working fine.
i am sorry if "everyone" is wrong, but your message trimming suggest i 
am "everyone" all by myself...
i like your prompt by the way.
