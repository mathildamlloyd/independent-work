microsoft knowledge base article q172668: barney fun on imagination island 
error message: barney not found[1]. microsoft actimates interactive barney may 
conflict with a wide range of radio-operated electronic devices, including 
burglar alarms, resulting in the dreaded barney not found error. 
to resolve this problem, microsoft recommends turning off your burglar alarm. 

incidentally, this is the funniest ms kbase article i've seen since earth 
rotates in wrong direction[2].
