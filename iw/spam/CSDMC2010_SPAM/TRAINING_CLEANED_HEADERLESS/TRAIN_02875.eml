there have been a number of releases since march 2009 so i'd like to =
know if the information on that page regarding the possible values of =
"jvmversion" is still relevant:

=
http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/java/reference/java_i=
nfoplistref/articles/javadictionaryinfo.plistkeys.html

especially the part where it is written that the "1.n*" values are not =
recommended.

thanks in advance.
