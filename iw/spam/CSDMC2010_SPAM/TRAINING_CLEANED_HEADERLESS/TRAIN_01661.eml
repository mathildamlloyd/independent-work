hello gary,


uh, plague is not action.  no, no one has a problem quarantining
someone who has say, ebola, or malaria, because diseases do not
require any decisive action -- just contact.

fantasies, still require decisive action, even if its in conjunction
with the way the fantasy works in the individual's brain. many people
have very strange and obscure fantasies (say wanting to be a model)
that dont' require them to be locked up.

fantasies aren't nearly as much like plagues.   not everyone in a
given population necessarily adheres to that given fantasy, whereas
everyone can get a given plague.   (btw, gary, the whole concept of
monitoring a given 'racial populaiton' for fear of them getting a
plague is silly.  i don't think plagues discriminate)

you're trying to argue for a lock'em all up mentality, when i don't
think anyone but you has even mentioned it.   his point was that
fantaesies were a psychological? explanation for a possible event.
not that all people who have them, or even have a certain type, need
to be locked up, quarantined, killed, rubbed-out or cleansed.
