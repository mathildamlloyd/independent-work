after logging in as somebody with administrator privileges, i *was*
able to select the 'in their own process' preference, and safari then
worked as advertised. i was also then able to change this preference
from my own account (without admin privileges).

re the lack of two-finger scrolling in chrome own-process applets,
this turns out to occur only when the browser window is on my
secondary display(!) (plugged into my macbook), and applies to safari
as well. this i describe in a bug report i've just submitted.
