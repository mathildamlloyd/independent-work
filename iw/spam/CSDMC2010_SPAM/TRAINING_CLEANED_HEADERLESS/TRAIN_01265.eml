it looks ok to me; your custom rules file is read by udev (line 24) and
the corresponding variables are set (lines 110-116).

i now tried to activate the extra options in the fdi file that comes
with xserver-xorg-input-synaptics and that gave me right-edge-scrolling
and the other stuff. thus it seems that the fdi directives are working
right now on my sid system. (as i wrote earlier, i have not used these
features in a long while, therefore i do not know if the fdi files
worked all the time or if this functionality was only recently
restored.)

i suggest that you try the same approach and then we can compare our
results. in other words:

1) shut down x and remove your custom udev rules for the time being,
   then restart udev. (invoke-rc.d udev restart)

2) uncomment the extra rules in
   /usr/share/hal/fdi/policy/20thirdparty/11-x11-synaptics.fdi. you have
   to close the comment in the "" to
   the end of this line; also insert a new line with "
