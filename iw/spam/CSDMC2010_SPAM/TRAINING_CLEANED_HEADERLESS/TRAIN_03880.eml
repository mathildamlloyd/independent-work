conor - it's a rather large continent - people might need to know where you
are going to suggest sources. and if you're buying abroad, make sure you get
to test it - many places won't have facilities for you to do that.

any monitor should just work - they all have vga connectors and any half
decent brand will be know about by xfree setup programs in modern
distributions. however, if you have the budget (insurance paying for the
dead monitor, perhaps ? - and where was your monitor that it got caught in a
flood ?) getting a monitor with a dvi input is best. of course, you'll need
a dvi out video card then, too. dvi provides a much better picture than vga
because it removes the analog stage - basically dvi gives you a direct
connection from video ram pixels to monitor pixels - the best pictures i've
ever seen on a computer is on my notebook screen at 1400x1050 (which doesn't
use dvi, but an internal connection which has the same effect). brand wise,
i like iiyama a lot and i think they may have a europe wide warranty.
