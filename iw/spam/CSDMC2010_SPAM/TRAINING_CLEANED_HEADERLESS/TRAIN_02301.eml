doing stuff in your own is easy. doing stuff coordinating with a whole distro,
whithin ugly hacks and with a good ending quality, is not.

btw, i would rather advise people learn how to build their own packages before
using and thus depending in this 3rd party repo, no only because security reasons, 
or because it is not built in the top of debian.  this repo is not going to be 
there forever, for sure, sooner or later people maintaining it will get tired, 
and if you are planning to use kde 3 forever...

just pointing about this to people mentioning this repo, nothing direclty to
martin here :)
