my domain smb knowledge is slightly rusty but here goes...

1. your samba server's ip address ends with a 0, which, afaik, is
reserved for network addresses (unless it has some special purpose
like the the /32 netmask). what is the output of "ifconfig -a"?

2. in your smb.conf:

2.a the following are missing (although they may be the default
settings for these variables):
security =3d user
local master =3d yes

2.b i have forgotten why, but afaik "127.0.0.1" should be listed in
"interfaces =3d".

2.c what does "share modes =3d no" do?

3. if you have not yet created a computer account for the windows box,
you have to log on to the domain as root (or as a user with the right
to add a machine account) the first time that you do so from a samba
client for the "add machine script =3d" variable to do its magic.

4. the "_ldap._tcp...." dns srv records are needed for an ad domain
(iirc there are 6 +-1). i have never set up an ad samba pdc but your
smb.conf settings look like those of an nt4 samba pdc so it may just
be a misleading error/failure message. your windows box seems to be an
xp vm but just in case the netbios name is misleading, see
http://wiki.samba.org/index.php/windows7
