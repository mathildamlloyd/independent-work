hi,

perhaps

#chown -r john /home/john

or any username you use ?

if this does'nt work, you can try to create a new user and then cope al=
l your
files to /home/new-user.


nope did not help. adding a new user did not fix a=
nything too. i tried login in a console and then startx and i got some erro=
rs about xkb not being able to get initialized. strange....=a0 so the thing=
 is that no user except the root can start a kde session.
