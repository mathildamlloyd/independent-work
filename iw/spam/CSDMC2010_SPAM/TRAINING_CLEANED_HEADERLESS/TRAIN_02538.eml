yes.  the x server is completely secondary, and i don't think apple java
interacts with it at all.

right.

if you are using awt, you need to give your program access to the
console.  apple uses a mach-involved security model of namespaces to
control access to various things; you can find more information on it at
http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/technotes/tn2005/tn2083.html.
worth reading.  several times.

but the pertinent bit is ``a process can only use the global window
server service if its euid is 0 (it's running as root) or matches the
uid of the console user. all other users are barred from using it.''

i don't see an update of this document for 10.6, either.

you could try installing another java that includes a client xlib
implementation, and go from there.  or, of course, run your program on
linux or freebsd or opensolaris instead.
