hi,

i noticed on many computers with debian, whatever the kernel (2.6.xx, xx
>=3d 26), that, once ``too much'' tabs have been opened, firefox/icewease=
l
becomes sluggish, slower and slower, and often stalls after some time. i
also noticed that, when becoming more and more sluggish, it takes more
and more ram, even when all the pages are completely loaded. why? am i
the only person who's experiencing this? is there an objective
explanation to this?
