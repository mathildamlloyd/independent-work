well, wfm.

do you have a log of the shutdown messages that appear on the console?  the=
y=20
might tell us why your filesystem is not getting cleanly re-mounted read-on=
ly.

yes.  many, many more times.  a filesystem that can't grow is beyond useles=
s=20
for me.  luckily btrfs support growing and shrinking and it can do both whi=
le=20
mounted.  on-line shrinking is a trick i couldn't get reiser3 to perform.

well, i will still have to have a "partition" for grub to embed stage 1.5 i=
f i=20
go with gpt.  however, it won't contain files per se.  i like having as muc=
h=20
as possible on lvm because it makes it easier to migrate to new storage med=
ia=20
and retire the old media.
