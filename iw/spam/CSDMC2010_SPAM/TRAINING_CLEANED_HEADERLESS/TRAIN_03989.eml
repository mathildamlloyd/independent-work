hi all,

i was having some problems with ooffice so i did "apt-get update" and
then ran "apt-get upgrade" to see if ooffice was among the packages to
be upgraded.  it wasn't, but i tried "apt-get install ooffice"
anyway, and presto it started upgrading ooffice.

so i looked at the man-page:

 upgrade
is used to install the newest versions of all packages currently
installed on the system

i did, in fact, have ooffice installed so i'm not clean on why upgrade
alone did seem to want to upgrade the package.

any ideas ?

thanks,

brian
