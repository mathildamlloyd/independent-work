my current open applications on a normal work day:
kontact (running kmail and akregator)
konqueror (with khtml kpart)
ark
kdevelop

kopete
konsole
okular

i'm not sure which of these apps i use that aren't a kde app, except the
qt-only app that i'm doing as a part of my day job.

sometimes i do have a vmware running to compile test on windows, and
sometimes i need to show off my graphical skills (what skills?) in
inkscape. these are hte only non-kde apps that i actually use.
