what's the best mechanism to migrate a working bootable system from one
drive to a smaller capacity drive?

e.g. take this 226g filesystem

df -h
filesystem            size  used avail use% mounted on
/dev/sdb1             226g  4.1g  210g   2% /
tmpfs                 3.0g     0  3.0g   0% /lib/init/rw
udev                  3.0g  244k  3.0g   1% /dev
tmpfs                 3.0g     0  3.0g   0% /dev/shm

and transfer it onto say a 32g drive?
