thanks both. (@andrei: it was in the content of the file, sorry not to
have specified it before.)

i am using the second command. the problem is that, for one set of
files (that i have selected, no problem for this), i have to use a
really simple expression: i need to find all the occurences of
`\paragraph{}' and replace them with nothing (i.e. with `'). i know
regexps, but replacing `$regexp' with `\paragraph{}' gives error
messages. any idea? thanks.
