it looks not so normal to me.

but looking at debian wiki for eee systems it seems to be a known issue 
with power management:

power management

on some models, the battery info is not very precise (jumps from 10% to 
100%, no rate information, etc.). apparently, this is normal. it appears 
that the userspace battery utilities expect the battery to report mah, 
but in fact it reports percentage. this is either a bug in the battery 
firmware or a bug in the bios; it is known to be fixed with newer bios 
versions and kernels  2.6.25.
