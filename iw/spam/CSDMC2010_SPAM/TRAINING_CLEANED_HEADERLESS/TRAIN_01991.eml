quite some modules from cpan do have a line like this nowadays (i think or 
read so somewhere, respectively). and the perl error message is very clear: 
"extutils::makemaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at 
makefile.pl line 2."

i could think of a solution: we could remove the "use" line and add the 
version to prereq_pm. after writemakefile() we could add the lines 
  require extutils::makemaker; 
  extutils::makemaker->version(5.45); 
to do per hand what 'use extutils::makemaker 5.45' does automagically; `perl 
makefile.pl` will die with a "uncaught exception from user code: 
extutils::makemaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at 
makefile.pl line 103." there but we've got a makefile. but i don't know if 
cpan will run the make anyway...

we could call the preprocessor on install time. that's not a very clean 
approach but could work. 
 
we can also overwrite pm_to_blib in the makefile directly per postamble. we 
already have a useless line "pm_to_blib: spamassassin doc/.made" there. adding 
some commands in this section gives some make warnings ("makefile:933: 
warning: overriding commands for target `pm_to_blib' makefile:877: warning: 
ignoring old commands for target `pm_to_blib'") but does work. not a very good 
solution either.

the "use makemaker::..." error message is imho quite clear, so i think it's ok 
to require the user to do a manual update of extutils::makemaker before the sa 
installation. but that's just my opinion ;-) 
 
i'll ask on makemaker@perl.org for the best solution. they should know.
