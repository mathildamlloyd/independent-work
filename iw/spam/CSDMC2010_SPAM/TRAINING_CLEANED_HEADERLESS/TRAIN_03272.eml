enterprise java education strategies


floyd marinescu to co-teach j2ee patterns - sept 16, dallas 

dear tss members,


i thought you'd be interested to know that the middleware company has created a j2ee patterns training course that i will be co-teaching in dallas during the week of september 16th. the course combines and improves upon the best j2ee design patterns material available in my book ejb design patterns, sun's core patterns, theserverside's patterns repository and others. 



i have just reviewed the final material and i am very excited with the end product. this class takes an indepth look at all the most important patterns today, both from a theoretical and a practical perspective. one of the cool things about the course is that it shows you how the patterns were implemented in a variety of popular open source frameworks and production applications, including theserverside.com. 


i highly recommend this course to the seasoned j2ee developer who wants to master the cutting edge in j2ee architecture and design. 


if you'd like to register for the course, simply click here:

sincerely, 

floyd marinescu 
author, ejb design patterns 
director of theserverside.com j2ee community

new patterns 


  ixml pattern   
 by venkatesh balakumar   

 

 
in due course, we will be finding ourselves in the middle of web services, which will granulate into representing all data in xml. for preparing and implementing web services, it's necessary to express all data in xml. this pattern does the same.

 widget pages   
 by guilherme silva   

 

 
this pattern allows for using xmlc and barracuda without exposing their apis to widget users. in fact it allows for transparently using more than one widget implementation at the same time, which is ideal for migrating or upgrading.

new app server reviews 


 jrun 4.0 - good stuff    
 by jason mckerr   

 

 
some general impressions i had of jrun: it's very easy to get it up and running.  
allaire-now-macromedia has always had one of my favorite servlet engines. 
the java management console (web-based admin interface) has gotten a tonne better.  
it's dead easy to plug into just about any ide (i've done it with jbuilder enterprise 6, and the intellij idea eap (builds 640 -642). 
the jsp compiler is smokin! very, very fast. i think it must come with jikes or something.
