using razor2 via spamassasin.

system is solaris 2.7, with qmail. spamassassin run via user's procmail.
all users who use sa have run razor-register.

razor2 is failing, and i can't find anything in the limited docs or on 
google on it,
and i'm hoping someone can help.

the error (which doesn't prevent sa from working) is:

oct  2 06:38:22 sancho2 qmail: 1033565902.186041 delivery 4588: success: 
razor2_check_skipped:_bad_file_number_can't_locate_object_m
ethod_"new"_via_package_"razor2::client::agent"_(perhaps_you_forgot_to_load_"razor2::client::agent"?)_at_/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_p
erl/5.6.1/mail/spamassassin/dns.pm_line_374./did_0+0+1/

looking at dns.pm doesn't really help me, and razor2::client::agent appears 
to be in the right place,
in /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/razor2/client.

ideas?
