off the top of my head:

safari will pickup plugin2 if plugin1 is not present - which java =
preferences toggles
chrome picks up plugin2 only
firefox is hardwired to plugin1 with the jep/mrj, unless you remove it =
them from (app)/contents/macos/plugins
camino is also hardwired with the jep/mrj, but does not pick up plugin2 =
if they are disabled (not sure why)
opera seems to always die on launch for me
