juan

this is what i found too.  the iw add-on "tor button" configuration 
located at

 preferences/ proxy settings

lists 2 options:

(a) use the recommended proxy settings for my version of firefox (and a 
checkbox is marked next to the only sub-option "use polipo" by default) or
(b) use custom proxy settings

hand on heart i could not say when this change took place as i haven't 
been using iw + tor + privoxy for a while, so this came as quite a 
surprise.  there was a recent update to tor though, iirc, so it may well 
have been during that.
