i first want to know if i'm the only one and/or try to find the cause of the issue before filing a bug 
report.
but i'll start a separate thread for it.

nope, hibernating does not work with the nvidia driver, but i didn't/couldn't test it with the 
nouveau driver, since i couldn't get a login screen to begin with and ctl+alt+f1 didn't respond 
either, so it was unusable for me.
had to do ctl+alt+sysrq+(reisub) and boot into single user mode to get my system working again.

desktop effects seems to be disabled by default on laptops, so that's probably not it.
