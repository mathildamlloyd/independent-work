correct, the folder structure clearly shows the plugins folder, it is my
understanding that both packages come from the sources i mentioned in my
previous e-mail.
in that plugins folder, for the notification icon, gtkstatusicon is
used, the diff doesn't mention either eggtrayicon or gtkstatusicon, so i
would assume that patch is included.

still leaves me with this issue, unfortunatly.
