No.  I believe in Akonadi as a technology and I don't have a problem with i=

Again, would Debian accept such a patch?  Upstream intends that patch for K=

SC 4.5, and I don't believe they will apply it to the KDE SC 4.4.x line.

I know the majority of the work has already been done.  I can probably=20

to start the work if there's no chance for it to get into Debian.
