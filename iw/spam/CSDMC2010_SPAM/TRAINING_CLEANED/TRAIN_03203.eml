NoneProblem with ALC662 Intel HDAFrom nobody Tue Dec 16 07:55:44 2014

Hello everybody,

I have a problem with my sound card (nVidia Corporation MCP67 High
Definition Audio | ALC662 High Definition Audio) and I would like you to
indicate the best location and the best way for me to report the bug that I
will describe:

After a fresh installation and setup of alsa, I only have sound in one of
two outputs and the microphone does not work. After reading a lot of
documentation about the subject, I found that inserting the line "options
snd-hda-intel model = 3stack 6ch-index = 0" in alsa-base.conf file I can
make my sound card work better, but with some problems, which are:

a) If I select the 6-channel mode (in kmix or alsa-mixer), the two sound
outputs work but the microphone do not work.
b) If I select the 2-channel mode (in kmix or alsa-mixer), the microphone
works but only one sound output works.

You do not agree with me that this is a bug? I've been experiencing it in
different distributions and several versions of the Linux kernel. As in
several versions of ALSA.

Before you ask me, yes, I've tried all the options associated with ALC662
codec (
http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/sound/alsa/HD-Audio-Models.txt)
and the option mentioned above was that worked best.


 I am a novice user of Linux. So I ask you for help. How could I help solve
this problem? What is the right place to report this bug?

Thanks,
