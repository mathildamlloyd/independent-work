NoneApt-get questionHi All Folks,

I have 'APT' installed and updated from 'freshmeat.net.  But I failed using it

# apt-get install 
/mnt/cdrom/Linux/CDBurner/cdrtools-cdrecord-1.11a23-1.i386.rpm
Processing File Dependencies... Done
Reading Package Lists... Done
Building Dependency Tree... Done
E: Couldn't find package 
/mnt/cdrom/Linux/CDBurner/cdrtools-cdrecord-1.11a23-1.i386.rpm

The file 'cdrtools-cdrecord-1.11a23-1.i386.rpm' is there

I performed another test copying the file 
'cdrtools-cdrecord-1.11a23-1.i386.rpm' to /root/Download

# apt-get install /root/Download/cdrtools-cdrecord-1.11a23-1.i386.rpm
Processing File Dependencies... Done
Reading Package Lists... Done
Building Dependency Tree... Done
E: Couldn't find package /root/Download/cdrtools-cdrecord-1.11a23-1.i386.rpm

Still failed.  Finally I rpm 'cdrtools-cdrecord-1.11a23-1.i386.rpm' from the 
CD and suceeded.

Kindly advise what mistake I have committed.

Thanks in advance.

Stephen Liu
