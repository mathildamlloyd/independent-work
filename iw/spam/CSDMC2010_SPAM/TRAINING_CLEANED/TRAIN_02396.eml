        I don't particularly want PIM, either.  KPackage, IceWeasel, Ksensors,
NUT, Wine, and WireShark are all I really care about.  Only Ksensors
and KPackage require KDE.  You say, "no way to keep all of KDE..".  I
don't care about all of KDE.  I only want KDM and the utilities I
listed above, plus of course the terminal servers.

        That's really bad news.  Without KPackage, there really isn't much
reason to run KDE.

        i don't particularly want pim, either.  kpackage, iceweasel, ksensors,
nut, wine, and wireshark are all i really care about.  only ksensors
and kpackage require kde.  you say, "no way to keep all of kde..".  i
don't care about all of kde.  i only want kdm and the utilities i
listed above, plus of course the terminal servers.

        that's really bad news.  without kpackage, there really isn't much
