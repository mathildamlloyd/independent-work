None[Razor-users] The -lm 4 bluesUsing -lm 4 is yielding an extra 20% a day, but it gets false positives
where it shouldn't.

Such as an email with a Word doc and the signature below.  After looking at
the Word doc, directions to the sender's cabin, I am convinced it marked the
body, which contains no next except the "IncrediMail advertisment"
signature, as spam.

So I have to turn off -lm 4.  Razor has been getting other strange emails it
shouldn't with -lm 4 on.

      See the incredimail ad signature I am talking about below:

      Fox
