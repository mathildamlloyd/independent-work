NoneApt repository authentication: it's time
    Cliped from the latest CERT.org warning list:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"I. Description

   The  CERT/CC  has received confirmation that some copies of the source
   code  for  the  Sendmail  package have been modified by an intruder to
   contain a Trojan horse.

   The following files were modified to include the malicious code:

     sendmail.8.12.6.tar.Z
     sendmail.8.12.6.tar.gz

   These  files  began  to  appear  in  downloads  from  the  FTP  server
   ftp.sendmail.org  on  or  around  September  28,  2002.  The  Sendmail
   development  team  disabled  the  compromised FTP server on October 6,
   2002  at  approximately  22:15  PDT.  It  does  not appear that copies
   downloaded  via  HTTP contained the Trojan horse; however, the CERT/CC
   encourages  users  who  may  have  downloaded the source code via HTTP
   during  this  time  period  to take the steps outlined in the Solution
   section as a precautionary measure."

     OK, it's now time to work out the PGP securing of apt repository traffic. I've never gotten anything but "sitename.whatever will not be authenticated" until running Redhat 8.0 when I get something about having "No Key" for various files.

    What's it take to ensure we're covered against this kind of childish/moronic/Microsoft-era problems?
