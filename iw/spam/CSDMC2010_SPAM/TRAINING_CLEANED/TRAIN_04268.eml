 If you need capital for your business or want to know how much it's
worth,
 Call Us Today!

Tap the hidden value of your business 
and get the cash you need today.

You've got money coming to you. But because it's in the form of renewal
commissions, it comes slowly. A little every year.

We're TWG Capital. We help turn your renewal commissions into immediate
cash - cash you can use any way you see fit. We are currently purchasing
renewal commissions from the following product lines: Long Term Care,
Medicare Supplement, Specified Disease, Life, and Health insurance.
