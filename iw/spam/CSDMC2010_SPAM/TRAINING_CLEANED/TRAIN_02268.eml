I was puzzled at first, but I think I understand what happened.

First, I approved the post because it didn't appear to be spam, even
though it wasn't from a member.  I thought it was odd that someone
wanted to send the MIME blurb to the list, but it was not really that
different from causing the New York Times web site to send a story to
the list.  (Except that the bits here are antediluvian, but old bits are
a problem to be solved by social opporobrium, not technical constraints.)

But I think what actually happened is that some idiot got infected by
Klez and had both FoRK and the pine-robot autoresponder address in their
mailbox or addressbook, so Klez forged mail from fork@xent.com to the
autoresponder, which responded.  To FoRK.
