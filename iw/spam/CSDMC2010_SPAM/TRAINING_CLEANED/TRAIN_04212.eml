 I don't really see the problem... either the whole message is unwanted spam
which you, one way or another, didn't agree to reciving, or it's something that
you, one way or another, said that you'd accept... If you said you'd accept it,
like mailinglists, then it isn't spam and shouldn't be caught as spam, no
matter if there's ads in it or not...
