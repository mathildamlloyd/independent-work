NoneJavaSound demo that is shipped under :

/Developer/Extras/Java/Sound/JavaSoundDemo/

The JavaSound demo that is on this site is old and buggy :

> http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/sound/samples/JavaSoundDemo/

When running it, it fails with an error in the demo : (this is a demo =
bug, which we fixed in our demo code)

Exception in thread "Juke" java.lang.NullPointerException
	at Juke.setGain(Juke.java:464)
	at Juke.playSound(Juke.java:301)
	at Juke.run(Juke.java:410)
	at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:637)

Please use the demo from /Developer/Extras/Java/Sound/JavaSoundDemo/.

Both .mid and .RMF files play fine. As of Update 1, we also support =
external MIDI devices.
