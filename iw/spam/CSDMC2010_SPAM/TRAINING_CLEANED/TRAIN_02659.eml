None>Make sure you have this in your .spamassassin/user_prefs:

This might be a problem.  I'll have to look into it further.  I just 
got SA working yesterday.  It's being called from MIMEDefang.  I'm 
not sure if it will look for user preferences when run like that. 
One would hope it would be I can't say for certain.  I'll look in to 
it.

Yeah, I disabled the subject rewrite.  I also lowered required_hits 
to 1 (wonder if I can do zero) so that almost all mail is scored--I'm 
testing it right now.  auto_report_threshold was raised to 100 to 
make sure that all mail gets through to me for now.

Ah, now I didn't notice this.  I rather like this option.  I may set 
my global default to this.

This makes sense.  I may do that for just this reason.  Thanks!
