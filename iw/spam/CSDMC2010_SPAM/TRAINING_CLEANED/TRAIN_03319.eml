Nonea deadlock problemHi XFS developers,
When studying xfs code(2.4.19), I found that the inode will be locked by 
XFS_ILOCK_SHARE flags before we get acl, which may cause deadlock.
Because when getting acl, it will allocate memory in KM_SLEEP, If the 
memory is tight, the process will call xfs_strategy, and may 
lock(XFS_ILOCK_SHARE)the same inode again. If between these two locks, 
another process try to lock the inode by XFS_ILOCK_EXCL, these two 
processes  will be deadlock. As follows,

    A process get ea                         B process want lock ipA

1) xfs_ilock(ipA, XFS_ILOCK_SHARE)             .....................
            |                                         |
            |                                         |
         get acl                        2) xfs_ilock(ipA, XFS_ILOCK_EXCL)
            |                                         |
            |                                         |
        memory tight
            |
            |
        xfs_stragegy
            |
            |
3)xfs_ilock(ipA, XFS_ILOCK_SHARE)        ............................

  these two processes will be dead lock.

So I believe that acl allocation GFP_MASKshould be changed to KM_NOFS.
right?

best regards
                                                 wdd




a deadlock problemhi xfs developers,
when studying xfs code(2.4.19), i found that the inode will be locked by 
xfs_ilock_share flags before we get acl, which may cause deadlock.
because when getting acl, it will allocate memory in km_sleep, if the 
memory is tight, the process will call xfs_strategy, and may 
lock(xfs_ilock_share)the same inode again. if between these two locks, 
another process try to lock the inode by xfs_ilock_excl, these two 
processes  will be deadlock. as follows,

    a process get ea                         b process want lock ipa

1) xfs_ilock(ipa, xfs_ilock_share)             .....................
            |                                         |
            |                                         |
         get acl                        2) xfs_ilock(ipa, xfs_ilock_excl)
            |                                         |
            |                                         |
        memory tight
            |
            |
        xfs_stragegy
            |
            |
3)xfs_ilock(ipa, xfs_ilock_share)        ............................

  these two processes will be dead lock.

so i believe that acl allocation gfp_maskshould be changed to km_nofs.
right?

best regards
