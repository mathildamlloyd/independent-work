Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 updated

The Debian project is pleased to announce the ninth and final update of
its oldstable distribution Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 (codename "etch").

This update incorporates all security updates which have been released
for the oldstable release since the previous point release, with one
exception which it was unfortunately not possible to include, together
with a few adjustments to serious problems.

PLEASE NOTE: Security support for the oldstable distribution ended in
February 2010 [1] and no updates have been released since that point.

  1: http://www.debian.org/News/2010/20100121

Those who frequently install updates from security.debian.org won't
have to update many packages and most updates from security.debian.org
are included in this update.

New CD and DVD images containing updated packages and the regular
installation media accompanied with the package archive respectively
will be available soon at the regular locations.

Upgrading to this revision online is usually done by pointing the
aptitude (or apt) package tool (see the sources.list(5) manual page) to
one of Debian's many FTP or HTTP mirrors.  A comprehensive list of
mirrors is available at:

    <http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist>

Please note that the oldstable distribution will be moved from the main
archive to the archive.debian.org repository after June 6th 2010.
After this move, it will no longer be available from the main mirror
network.  More information about the distribution archive and a list of
mirrors is available at:

    <http://www.debian.org/distrib/archive>

The kernel image used by the installer has been updated to incorporate
a number of important and security-related fixes.

Unfortunately it was not possible to include the security updates for
the lcms package in this point release due to a mismatch between the
upstream tarball used for the security update and that already present
in the oldstable distribution.


Removed packages
----------------

The following packages were removed due to circumstances beyond our
control:

    Package                                Reason

    destar                                 Security issues
    libclass-dbi-loader-relationship-perl  License problems
    libhdate-pascal                        [source:hdate] Licensing issues
    loop-aes-modules-2.6-sparc32           [source:loop-aes] Corresponding source / kernel no longer in the archive
    loop-aes-modules-2.6-sparc64           [source:loop-aes] Corresponding source / kernel no longer in the archive
    loop-aes-modules-2.6-sparc64-smp       [source:loop-aes] Corresponding source / kernel no longer in the archive
    loop-aes-modules-2.6-vserver-sparc64   [source:loop-aes] Corresponding source / kernel no longer in the archive
    rails                                  Security and usability issues

A few further packages were removed as a result, as they depend on
libclass-dbi-loader-relationship-perl; these packages are:

    maypole
    maypole-authentication-usersession-cookie
    maypole-plugin-upload
    memories


Additionally those parts of the libwww-search-perl and
libperl4caml-ocaml-dev packages which rely on the Google SOAP search
API (provided by libnet-google-perl) are no longer functional as the
API has been retired by Google.  The remaining portions of the packages
will continue to function as before.

debian gnu/linux 4.0 updated

the debian project is pleased to announce the ninth and final update of
its oldstable distribution debian gnu/linux 4.0 (codename "etch").

this update incorporates all security updates which have been released
for the oldstable release since the previous point release, with one
exception which it was unfortunately not possible to include, together
with a few adjustments to serious problems.

please note: security support for the oldstable distribution ended in
february 2010 [1] and no updates have been released since that point.

  1: http://www.debian.org/news/2010/20100121

those who frequently install updates from security.debian.org won't
have to update many packages and most updates from security.debian.org
are included in this update.

new cd and dvd images containing updated packages and the regular
installation media accompanied with the package archive respectively
will be available soon at the regular locations.

upgrading to this revision online is usually done by pointing the
aptitude (or apt) package tool (see the sources.list(5) manual page) to
one of debian's many ftp or http mirrors.  a comprehensive list of
mirrors is available at:

    

please note that the oldstable distribution will be moved from the main
archive to the archive.debian.org repository after june 6th 2010.
after this move, it will no longer be available from the main mirror
network.  more information about the distribution archive and a list of
mirrors is available at:

a number of important and security-related fixes.

unfortunately it was not possible to include the security updates for
the lcms package in this point release due to a mismatch between the
upstream tarball used for the security update and that already present
in the oldstable distribution.


removed packages
----------------

the following packages were removed due to circumstances beyond our
control:

    package                                reason

    destar                                 security issues
    libclass-dbi-loader-relationship-perl  license problems
    libhdate-pascal                        [source:hdate] licensing issues
    loop-aes-modules-2.6-sparc32           [source:loop-aes] corresponding source / kernel no longer in the archive
    loop-aes-modules-2.6-sparc64           [source:loop-aes] corresponding source / kernel no longer in the archive
    loop-aes-modules-2.6-sparc64-smp       [source:loop-aes] corresponding source / kernel no longer in the archive
    loop-aes-modules-2.6-vserver-sparc64   [source:loop-aes] corresponding source / kernel no longer in the archive
    rails                                  security and usability issues

a few further packages were removed as a result, as they depend on
libclass-dbi-loader-relationship-perl; these packages are:

    maypole
    maypole-authentication-usersession-cookie
    maypole-plugin-upload
    memories


additionally those parts of the libwww-search-perl and
libperl4caml-ocaml-dev packages which rely on the google soap search
api (provided by libnet-google-perl) are no longer functional as the
api has been retired by google.  the remaining portions of the packages
will continue to function as before.
