Seriously consider using Raid 6. If you use Raid 5 then the
probability of an unrecoverable read error (URE) occurring while
rebuilding the 4TB of data is IMO a little too high. With Raid 6 it
would require 2 URE's that happen to be located in the same raid
segment on both disks - the odds of that are extremely low.
