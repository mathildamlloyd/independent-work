I ran into a problem doing this a few years ago, where calling
-conformsToProtocol: would cause a hang when the protocol was

i ran into a problem doing this a few years ago, where calling
-conformstoprotocol: would cause a hang when the protocol was 
implemented in a category.  that might be fixed by now, but be
