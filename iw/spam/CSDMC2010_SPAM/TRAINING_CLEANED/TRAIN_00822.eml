NoneDebian and touch-screensHi all.

I=B4m working in a project that we would like to install in a =
touch-screen compact computer. My intention is to use Debian as the OS, =
and i'm searching for that kind of hardware with support for =
Debian/Linux. Most of them support Windows but it=B4s not clear if =
Debian will work as well. I've found some support for touch screens =
(some models), but not clear for integrated/compact systems. Someone =
knows where to look for?, or has some experience?, some URL?

Thanks in advance,
