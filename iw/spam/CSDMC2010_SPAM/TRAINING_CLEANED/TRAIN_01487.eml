  Battle of the Planets in DivX Video!
  ------------------------------------
  
  One of the best things about DivX Video is the way it has opened
  up distribution possibilities for a lot of cool videos that may
  not otherwise be widely seen. From independent short films to cult
  movies with strong underground followings, a number of filmmakers
  and distributors are discovering that DivX Video provides a great
  way to get their content in front of new audiences.
  
  A perfect example of that phenomenon is the groundbreaking
  animated series "Battle of the Planets" from Sandy Frank
  Entertainment. Originally shown on American television in the late
  1970s, Battle of the Planets gained a popular following and was
  one of the forerunners of the wildly popular anime style. The
  series chronicled the adventures of a group of intergalactic
  adventurers as they battled evil and protected the universe from
  invaders. Beloved among anime fans, 70s nostalgia buffs, and
  anyone who enjoys great sci-fi animation, the series is the
  subject of a number of fan sites and discussion groups throughout
  the Internet. You can now re-live the adventures of the Battle of
  the Planets crew in high-quality DivX video. The classic episode
  "Mammoth Shark Menace" is currently featured on the DivX Showcase,
  and stay tuned for more news about future Battle of the Planets
  episodes to come.

* Watch "Battle of the Planets 55: Mammoth Shark Menace" in the
  DivX Showcase:

  Warcraft III Sets Sales Records
  -------------------------------

  A while ago, we told you that the highly anticipated game
  "Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos" from Blizzard Entertainment would
  feature DivX Video for cinematic cut scenes. In early July,
  Blizzard released "Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos" with
  record-setting results, shipping over 4.5 million copies to
  retailers. Coincidence? You be the judge. You can look forward to
  more announcements about DivX technology in some of your favorite
  games in the near future....

  The Latest DivX Player Skins
  ----------------------------

  Let's face it--if you don't have the latest Player skins, you're
  just not cool.
  
* DisPlayer: A sleek, stylish full-screen skin that will give you
  the home theatre experience on your PC. Submitted by "DIVX
  Budman."
  <http://rd.mailshell.com/www.divx.com/skins/detail.php?id=72>
  
* Coldfusion: A futuristic skin design dripping in coolness.
  Submitted by "gryphix."
  <http://rd.mailshell.com/www.divx.com/skins/detail.php?id=71>
  
* DVDesque: As the title suggests, this skin has a groovy DVD-player
  design to complement the DivX experience. Submitted by "NellyNel."
