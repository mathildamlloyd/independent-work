None[ILUG] Irish Copyright Law: some analysesTwo interesting analyses of the Irish implementation of copyright as led by, as
best I can tell, anticipation of the EUCD (since the Irish law was passed in
2000, and the EUCD is somewhat more recent than that). The pieces of interest
are the papers by Prof. Robert Clark, who perhaps might not be a bad choice of
speaker for some future LUG gathering. One of the more eye-opening comments in
the second of his papers is that Irish legislation is, in effect, more
draconian than the DMCA.

There are some other interesting pieces here, too, for anyone concerned about
copyright and the like in Ireland.

Cheers,
Waider. Props to Danny at NTK (www.ntk.net) for the link.
