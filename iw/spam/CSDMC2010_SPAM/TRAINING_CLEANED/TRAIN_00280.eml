Yes, this is what I would like to achieve. I would like the package
manager to switch back to the previous state. Then, I would open
aptitude and it will automatically propose the necessary downgrades (I
think). Thus I could quickly and painlessly restore the system (in
case it was broken by the upgrade) and then hunt down the offending
package when time permits.

What would be the concerned files?
