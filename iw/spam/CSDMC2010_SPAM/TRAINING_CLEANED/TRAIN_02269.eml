None[ILUG] Am I cracked?Well you know what I mean.

I noticed 2 connections from my
(freshly installed RH7.3) machine to
port 80 of the following addresses.

216.145.20.5
216.254.17.87

Both resolve to cytocin.hubbe.NET
using CCOM.NET & speakeasy.NET DNS
servers respectively.

Both connections lasted about 20
seconds and were about 2 minutes apart.
Any ideas?

I didn't see what processes they came from,
but I'm keeping a close eye now.

Thanks,
Pádraig.

p.s. I'm can't subscribe to the list
at the moment for some reason? so please
reply directly.
