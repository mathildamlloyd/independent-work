What about the carrot approach?  Find an even better 
backup method, compatible with Grub 2 and appealing 
to your management for its efficiency.

Or what about putting Grub on a USB flash which can 
be replicated easily and is largely independent of 
your main non-volatile storage.  The flash fails 
and you plug in another.  Main storage fails and 
you invoke the traditional backup.
