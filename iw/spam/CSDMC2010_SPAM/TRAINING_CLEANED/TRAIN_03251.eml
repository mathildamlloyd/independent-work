And I claim he would be better off using a card that doesn't use firmware[1=

or uses free firmware, since non-free firmware is an issue for distributors=

and it's relatively easy to "accidentally" participate in distributing=20
software in violation of its license.

I wouldn't want to be stuck without non-free available, but I recommend mak=

hardware purchases that allow you to avoid non-free as much as possible.  I=
