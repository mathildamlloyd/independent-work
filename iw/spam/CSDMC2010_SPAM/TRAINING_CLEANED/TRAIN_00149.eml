I run 10.5 on such a powerbook as well as a 1GHz G4 eMac. If anything 
performance overall was improved over 10.4. One have 1GB of RAM the other 
3/4 GB. The only downside was that at some point there was an update to 
10.5 where my firewire enclosure became unreliable. It seems to affect 
certain ide to fw bridge chips in hard drive enclosures and I was unlucky. 
I can usually power cycle the drive and try again successfully. It matters 
not which cable and drive I use, I have three enclosures, and once is the 
culprit.

With regards to X11, the growing pains are mostly over for me. I do use 
Xvnc for 8-bit though. This may be improved in later versions of X11 
though. The key options to Xvnc are -cc 3 -depth 8
