For all my recent packages that support --with and --without options, I've
put them in the %description section. See for instance :
http://psyche.freshrpms.net/rpm.html?id=80

Where you can see :
Available rpmbuild rebuild options :
--with : alsa
--without : aalib lirc libdv arts

The ogle package has also a --with alsa option, and I've had a bug report
about xine that I apparently unintentionally compiled with ALSA directly
:-/

I'd like to aks this on the rpm-zzzlist : Would a new dependency of 250k, the
alsa-lib package, for many packages (mplayer, ogle, xine) be a problem for
the freshrpms.net packages users? As I really feel like blending ALSA in
now, especially since I've just spent some time recompiling alsa-kernel
package for all the Psyche kernels!!!
