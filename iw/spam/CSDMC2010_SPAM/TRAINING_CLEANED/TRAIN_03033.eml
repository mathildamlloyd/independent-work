1)  I think the code is still very much pre-beta.

2)  When you go to the "Download" page, it tells you "Fetch the latest
versions of razor-agents and razor-agents-sdk packages"  It is not at all
clear that these are development packages.

The site is badly designed, and very misleading.  IMO.  The fact that the
word "beta" appears in the middle of some introductory text on the front
page is hardly a valid argument.  (Well accepted software design "fact":
USERS DON'T READ *ANYTHING*)

I get the impression that Vipul & co are deliberately trying to mislead
users into downloading the dev code in order to get more unwitting test
sites.

But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.

rOD.
