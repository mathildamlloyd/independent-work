So I haven't been totally wasting my time ( ;) ), since my tmta does
support outbound SSL / TLS connections, and indeed, that was a primary

Got it.  The O'reilly discussion that I saw also mentioned that qpsmtpd
was primarily meant to be used in conjunction with a normal MTA, and
not to replace one.
