You missed my point completely. What is subjectively unusable for you, is=20
perfectly usable for others and the other way round. Debian is not your=20

Insisting that others do something (revert to kdepim 4.3) based solely on y=

personal grievances does not help productive communication.

I've never said that you're the only one. I find myself in the odd position=

What facts? That kdepim/kmail needs akonadi? That's hardly news. Akonadi=20
integration is not stable enough? There is still time to improve it. That's=

what Ana's blog was about.

It is not like every mail client on the market suddenly needs MySQL. Actual=
ly,=20
kmail is probably unique in this area.

What I tried to say to you all this time, if Akonadi renders Kmail unusable=

you, switch the client! Akonadi by itself is not a bug, it is not going awa=

Take it or switch to something else, simple as that.
