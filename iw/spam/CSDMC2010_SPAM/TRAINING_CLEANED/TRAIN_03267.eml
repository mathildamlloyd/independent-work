You can run into that sort of problem if your pattern to replace contains a=
ny=20
forward slashes (/) in it.  If you need to such an expansion, you probably=
=20
want to do it in two passes, first doing a / to \/ substitution on your=20
replacement strings, then inserting them into your final expression:

pata=3D`echo $1 | sed 's,/,\/,'`
patb=3D`echo $2 | sed 's,/,\/,'`
sed -e "s/PATTERN1/$pata/" -e "s/PATTERN2/$patb/" < input > output
