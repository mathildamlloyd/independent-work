None[SAdev] Spam-Assassin nightly build 22-8-02Hello all,
I get problems with the latest nightly build from Spamassassin with
VMailMgr + OMail-Admin. 
It scans the mail and gives it an :

        X-Spam-Status: No, hits=11.4 required=7.0

Can someone look at the code for it? Maybe because option -F is gone?


Greetings
Erik Rudolfs
