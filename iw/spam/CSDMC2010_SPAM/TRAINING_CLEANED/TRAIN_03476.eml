Yes, another interesting way to use mplayer. You can use the
-dumpaudio option to get the raw audio data out of the file.  I am
usually not trying to get the raw audio however, because it might be
compressed or encoded in weird ways. I usally want to have a nice
uncompressed wav file that I can work with. And mplayer is pretty
handy for that...

So many choices!
