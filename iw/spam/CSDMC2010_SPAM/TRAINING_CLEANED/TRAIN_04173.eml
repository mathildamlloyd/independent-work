I am not quite sure what's an "appropriate negative literal" and whether =
it's present or absent, but perhaps it's just that there's a fine point =
there which escapes me (I do admit I did not check the doc, it might use =
the term before in a way which makes the statement unambiguous).

What we are -- in fact -- testing _implicitly_ is whether the _enm_ =
object variable might contain nil.

Or do implicit/explicit mean something else in English than in all other =
languages I bumped into?

re: nil messaging statement in "cocoa fundimentals guide"
misleading?p.s. matter of fact, far as i understant plain english, the first part =
is somewhat cryptic, too:
