Noneclaims that European diseases were devastating to all American
hemisphere populations, and the reverse was never true.  Unlike, for
example, India or Asia.

There is a hot dispute about the original size of the indigenous
population, but the evidence for a high density in the Mexican area is
sound.  It was up here in the North or in the Amazon where I'm a little
more suspicious of very high upward revisions.

At least that was my take.

I have never heard anyone seriously argue that European diseases were
not a significant factor, or that there were not in fact a lot of Aztec
people prior to Cortez.  Gee, I've never before heard someone argue
unseriously about it either.

Do you have a reference for a book or article which does so?

re: al'qaeda's fantasy ideology: policy review no. 114the die offs in areas with better records parallel and support the
claims that european diseases were devastating to all american
hemisphere populations, and the reverse was never true.  unlike, for
