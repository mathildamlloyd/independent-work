None[Razor-users] Fun Uses of Razored MailI'm taking all my razored mail today and calling any 1-800 numbers I can
find.  I say "Hi, I'm calling everyone that spammed me today to raise their
cost of doing business.  You have a great day!"  I'm told I should do it
from a pay phone, so it costs them 50 cents per call.  If more people did
this, we could tie up their phone lines and cost them so much money they
could never make spam work.

Also fun is the simple "Die Spammer Die!"
