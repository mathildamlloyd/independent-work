NoneAutomounting problems.I am running an up to date Lenny box with FVWM.  I do not run Gnome, or KDE.  I want to have removable devices, such as flash drives and mp3 players, automount.  I have read the mini How-To on automounting, but I still can't get it to work.

This is the relevant data:

$ cat /etc/auto.master

# $Id: auto.master,v 1.4 2005/01/04 14:36:54 raven Exp $
#
# Sample auto.master file
# This is an automounter map and it has the following format
# key [ -mount-options-separated-by-comma ] location
# For details of the format look at autofs(5).

#/smb   /etc/auto.smb

/mnt    /etc/auto.mnt

lexar           -fstype=vfat            LABEL="LEXAR MEDIA"



$ /etc/init.d/autofs status
Configured Mount Points:
------------------------
/usr/sbin/automount --timeout=300 /mnt file /etc/auto.mnt

Active Mount Points:
--------------------
/usr/sbin/automount --pid-file=/var/run/autofs/_mnt.pid --timeout=300 /mnt file /etc/auto.mnt


The last two lines in /etc/auto.mnt refer to the devices that I am trying to automount.  I would use UUID for lexar, but it is "0000-0000" and would conflict with other devices.  I unplugged the devices prior to updating the files, the replugged them, but they do not automount.  I made sure that there are no references to the files in /etc/fstab, but still no automounting.  I also tried reloading autofs and then replugging the devices.  Nothing.

What am I missing?

All help appreciated.
