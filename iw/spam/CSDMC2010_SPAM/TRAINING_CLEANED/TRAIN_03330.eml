Easy.

First, you'll have to excuse me as I'm still using 2.3.1 (*), so, this
may not play well with recent changes.  (I did look at 2.5.1, too).
And, I just did this off the top of my head (I wanted to see if it
(**) still worked), so this is somewhat untested.

Adding a menu entry is trivial; add this to your ~/.exmh/exmh-defaults:

*Fops.more.m.uentrylist:	ketchup
*Fops.more.m.l_ketchup:		Catch-up all b4 cur
*Fops.more.m.c_ketchup:	 	My_Mark2CurSeen

Then you just need to provide the source for My_Mark2CurSeen and 
arrange for Exmh to include it (put it in your ~/.tk/exmh directory
in your user.tcl; or in pick.patch if you enable the "source hook"
under Prefs->Hacking Support)

It's going to look something like this:

proc My_Mark2CurSeen {} {
    global exmh pick msg
    Exmh_Status "Clearing unseen up to cur..." red
    Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msg(id)
    set pick(ids) [...get message ids for "pick 1-cur"...]
    busy PickMarkSeen
    Exmh_Status ok blue
}

(that's based upon the guts of Pick_MarkSeen)

You need to fill in the code for the [...get...] section; I ran out of
time!
