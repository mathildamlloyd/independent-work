I think I may have been hit by bug 575137.  I am using btrfs, and there wer=
e=20
some issues during the install, but I do not believe I have suffered any fi=
le=20
system corruption in the dpkg databse or the aptitude package.

In particular, (debsums -a aptitude) reports all the files are in good=20
condition.  (update-alternatives --display aptitude) shows:
No alternatives for aptitude.

I initially installed 0.4.11.11-1~lenny1 on this system, but have since=20
upgraded to 0.6.1.5-3.  Is there a good way for me to establish an alternat=
ive=20
that will not mess up on the next upgrade?  Or, is this problem supposedly=

fixed in 0.6.2.1-2 and I should just upgrade now?
