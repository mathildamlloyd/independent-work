I'm told that even our best people occasionally screw up. And QA had
tested the rpm on an "Everything" install. Expect a fixed version soon,
and QA procedures have been adjusted to catch this kind of braindamage
in the future. There is nothing really wrong with the binary inside the
rpm, so if you want to --nodeps for now it's ok.
