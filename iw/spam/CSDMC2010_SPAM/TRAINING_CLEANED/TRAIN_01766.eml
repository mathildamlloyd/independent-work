Automatically marking something as ham after a given timeout.. regardless of how long 
that timeout is, someone is going to forget to submit the message back as spam. 

How many spams-as-hams can be accepted before the f-n rate gets unacceptable?

I view IMAP as a stop-gap measure until tighter integration with various email clients 
can be achieved.

I still feel it's better to require classification feedback from the recipient, rather than 
make any assumptions after some period of time passes. But this is an end-user issue 
and we're still at the algorithm stage.. ;-)
