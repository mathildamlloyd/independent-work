Rob "Pringles Can" Flickenger and others Cliff Skolnik at the O'Reilly OS X con 
has tracked down the cause of the annoying flakiness in the wireless network 
here -- every 20 or 30 seconds, you start getting "connection refused" messages 
from your browser and other net-utilities. Rob "Pringles Can" Flickenger wrote 
it up. 

It turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other 
"promiscuous" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same 
time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your 
segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a "rejected" message. 

So today, Rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around 
and tell people running Etherpeg to _turn off the firewall_ (and vice-versa). 
Ah, fickle networking, you are such a stern mistress! Link[2] Discuss[3] (_
Thanks, Rob!_)
