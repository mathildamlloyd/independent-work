None[SAtalk] SA CGI Configurator ScriptsI have been trying to research via SA mirrors and search engines if a canned
script exists giving clients access to their user_prefs options via a
web-based CGI interface. Numerous ISPs provide this feature to clients, but
so far I can find nothing. Our configuration uses Amavis-Postfix and ClamAV
for virus filtering and Procmail with SpamAssassin for spam filtering. I
would prefer not to have to write a script myself, but will appreciate any
suggestions.
