None/home/dudeHi,

some time now the following messages were haunting me:

     automount[11593]: attempting to mount entry /home/dude

It just came to my attention, that only freshrpm benefitting hosts showed this
up. I grepped through the binaries and found referrences to /home/dude.

# grep /home/dude /usr/bin/*
Binary file /usr/bin/aaxine matches
Binary file /usr/bin/gentoo matches
Binary file /usr/bin/gphoto2 matches
Binary file /usr/bin/gtkam matches
...

I am now relaxed again ;), and pass this info on. Probably Matthias Saou
himself is "dude", and some package has hardwired a path in his build
directory. It would be nice to find out which and fix it, but I am using too
many of the freshrpm suite to narrow it down.

Regards, Axel.
