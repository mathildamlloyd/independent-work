I'd suggest using Precedence: junk. Albeit it's no standard header does most 
Software already recognize it. Courier eg. doesn't send auto-replies to 
mails with the Precedence bulk or junk. I think Outlook does handle these 
special, too. [1] says:
| Autoresponses should always contain the header
|          Precedence: junk
| Notice the spelling of "prec-e-dence". In particular, count the number of
| n:s (and a:s and s:es, if you're totally agraphic and/or from the United
| States). This will prevent well-tempered mail programs from generating
| bounce messages for these. If the recipient can't be reached, the
| autoresponder message is simply discarded.
