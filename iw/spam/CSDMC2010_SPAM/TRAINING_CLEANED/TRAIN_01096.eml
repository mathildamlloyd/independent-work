NoneMovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer calling exit?I'm running QuickTime on Windows (XP SP3) and have a reproducible way to
make MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer in a C++ program do something strange.
It looks like it's calling exit() or doing something equivalent, but I can't
say for sure.   What I do see is that immediately after calling
MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer, execution continues in the destructors of my
statically allocated objects.  If I replace the call to
MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer with a call to exit(), I see the same thing.

I'm using version 7.3 of the QuickTime SDK, but 

long version;
Gestalt(gestaltQuickTimeVersion,&version);

populates version with 0x07668000.  I can reproduce the same behavior with
version 7.1 of the QuickTime SDK, but Gestalt still returns the same thing
in this case.

The QuickTime-related things that happen before this are:

- QuickTime initializes normally
- QuickTime reads metadata from one aac file
- QuickTime reads metadata from a second aac file
- Quicktime reads the audio properties of an mp3 file
- and then I call MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer

The audio-related function calls are:

MovieAudioExtractionBegin
MovieAudioExtractionGetProperty(kQTPropertyClass_MovieAudioExtraction_Audio,
 
kQTMovieAudioExtractionAudioPropertyID_AudioStreamBasicDescription);
MovieAudioExtractionSetProperty(kQTPropertyClass_MovieAudioExtraction_Audio,
 
kQTMovieAudioExtractionAudioPropertyID_AudioStreamBasicDescription);

all of which work as expected (or at least I think they do).

And then

MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer

I can give more details about the API calls if necessary.  I think I'm
calling QuickTime correctly since it decodes audio successfully almost all
the time -- with this file and many others (i.e.
MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer returns normally).  I've had customers report
similar problems, but this is the first time I've been able to reproduce it
reliably myself.  Unfortunately it's with a complex program.  My attempts to
reproduce this with a simpler program have failed.  It seems to be
timing-related but I can't do better than that at the moment.

I'd love some help figuring out what's happening in
MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer, and even better some help making it go away.
If I need to report this in some more official way to Apple to make that
happen, please let me know.

Thanks much.
