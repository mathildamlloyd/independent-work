Hi Florian,

The new xorg version migrated to testing today, and indeed contains the
file /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf. Setting the options
there enabled my special touchpad-tricks again. Thanks!

hi florian,

the new xorg version migrated to testing today, and indeed contains the
file /usr/share/x11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf. setting the options
there enabled my special touchpad-tricks again. thanks!
