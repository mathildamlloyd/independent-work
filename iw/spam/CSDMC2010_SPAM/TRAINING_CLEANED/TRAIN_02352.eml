None  | I can cut'n'paste from exmh's message display window into spawned
  | gvim processes, but not into anything else.

That's odd.  I cut & paste between all kinds of windows (exmh into
mozilla, xterm, another wish script of mine I use for DNS tasks (but
that one I guess is to be expected) netscape (when I used to use it,
but I suppose it and mozilla are the same codebase, approx) - in fact
I can't thing of anything it fails for, that I have noticed.

What is an example of an "anything else" that it fails for for you?
