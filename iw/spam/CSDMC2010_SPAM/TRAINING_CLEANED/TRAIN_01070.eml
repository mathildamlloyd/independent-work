NoneSequence Grabber and Movie Sync - Recording starts earlierHi everyone,

We are struggling with an offset issue in trying to sync a movie
playing in the background with the start of a sequence grabber record.
 The end result of the capture always seems to be ahead of the actual
movie that is playing back.  We are trying to pipe the end result into
an audio echo cancellation library and this offset is causing pain.

Here is the issue.

- We use SGDataProc callback for the recording and preview.
- We start by calling SGStartRecord() for the preview.
- We then PreRoll() the movie and set up all the capture movies.
- We share the SG SoundChannel clock with the movie, and the VideoChannel.
- After this is all complete we call SetMovieRate() to start the
movie.  And then log a time stamp from the clock for recording.  This
happens about 5 seconds after previewing.
- We call AddMediaSample() when the time stamps (adjusted for scale)
passed into the proc are greater than the time set for recording.  We
adjust the audio buffer and sample input so this is cut at the right
time based on the time stamp.
- We are using a USB Audio Mic and a USB Video Camera.
- We have good A/V sync (lip sync)
- When we compare the recorded track to the background track the
recorded echo starts before the echo in the movie.  This is by about
0.1 seconds give or take.  One would expect the echo to happen after
not before.

We have tried to manually offset the time stamp for start time.  But
this then produces A/V sync (lip sync) issues.  I assume this is
because our
video frame is getting there faster than our audio frame.  As one would expect.

Is there any reason why these frames are getting dropped in the
recording?  Does anyone have any ideas to get these 2 in sync.

Thx for your time,
Matt
