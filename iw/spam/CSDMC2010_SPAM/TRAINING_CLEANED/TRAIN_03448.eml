KMail from KDEPIM 4.3 did not require MySQL because it didn't require Akona=
di.
KMail from KDEPIM 4.4 does require MySQL because Akonadi form KDE SC 4.4=20
requires MySQL.
KMail from KDEPIM 4.5 might not require MySQL because Akonadi from KDE SC 4=

might not require MySQL.

My concern is the KMail -> MySQL relationship.  There are quite a few ways =

kmail from kdepim 4.4 does require mysql because akonadi form kde sc 4.4=20

kmail from kdepim 4.5 might not require mysql because akonadi from kde sc 4=
=2e5=20
might not require mysql.
