Well, I maintain about 4 Debian servers... and I've been using Debian=20
almost exclusively ever since the .deb packaging system got rolled out=20
(yeah... waaaayyy back). Because Ubuntu is a derivative of Debian (in=20

packaged for, or the Debian package is installable on, Ubuntu), and also =

because we in the Debian crowd have better kung-fu than those lame=20
GUI-installer Ubuntu-ites...... *and* because I've already been=20
subscribed on this list for several years....   I figured I'd ask here.
