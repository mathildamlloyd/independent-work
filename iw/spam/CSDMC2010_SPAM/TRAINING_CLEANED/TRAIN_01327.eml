No specific suggestions. A caution: go to a store and make
sure your future netbook supports ACPI. I've had bad
experiences with my cheap Toshiba Satellite L305 series
laptop: the fan controls (and most other ACPI registers) do
nothing.

It seems either Toshiba or the BIOS maker Insyde H2O has
chosen non-standard SSDT/DSDT table values, with the result
that only Microsoft's OS knows where to twiddle.

There are reports that the omnibook module will correctly
handle Insyde H2O BIOS'ed notebook. Have yet to test here.

Good luck,

Joel
