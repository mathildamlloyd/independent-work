Nonefiltering known to man is easily defeated by simply presenting the content
in the form of a graphic image (GIF, JPG, etc.).  I'm surprised that more
spammers don't already do this.  I know we have discussed this before, and
maybe we can detect this type of spam via the headers and with Razor/DCC (if
you're using them).  But that sure narrows down the ruleset (maybe that's
good).

Quite interesting -- it's pretty similar to the spam phrases stuff.  As
Scott pointed out, this would work quite well as a naive Bayesian system.
(in fact, I think it may be quite close to being one already...)

I like the way "FL" -- ie. Florida -- is one of the top scoring terms. ;)

Also, when I was doing the spam-phrases stuff, I discounted the ff0000
thing, as HTML garbage! never realised it corresponded to "bright red" :(
Have we got a test for that?

re: [satalk] paulgraham.com articleyes, it is very impressive.  however, all of the most advanced content
