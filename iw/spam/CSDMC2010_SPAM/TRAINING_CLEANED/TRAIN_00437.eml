Recently I was trying to show my 15 year old granddaughter, who runs Open S=
uSU=20
11 on her laptop, how to do some small admin job.  She said that she didn't=
=20
want to know.  When I queried this, she said:

"When I am at school, the IT department does it for me.  When I am at home=
=20
here, you do it for me.  When I am in Japan, Daddy does it for me.  Why do =
I=20
need to know how to do it?"
