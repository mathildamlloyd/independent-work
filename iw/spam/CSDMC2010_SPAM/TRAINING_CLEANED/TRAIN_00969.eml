that activity system in KDE's bugtracker, of which a user named Beat Wolf=20
marked most invalid in the last days cause this stuff gets completely=20
rewritten in KDE 4.5. In KDE 4.5 there will be a new activity system=20
sporting Nepomuk and whatnot, I think there has been a blog post, maybe by=
