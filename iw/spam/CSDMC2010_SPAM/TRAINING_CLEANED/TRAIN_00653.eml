Nonetrouble with TransferModeI'm developing a QT app on Windows, and am using a WSH javascript to =
control output from the application. I have everything working, except I =
want to make a track blend 50% with the background and it just doesn't =
seem to work. Here is what I'm using:

qtTargetMovie.QTControl.Movie.Tracks(3).top =3D =
qtTargetMovie.QTControl.Movie.height-qtTargetMovie.QTControl.Movie.Tracks(=
3).height;
qtTargetMovie.QTControl.Movie.Tracks(3).TransferMode =3D =
QTTransferModesEnum.qtTransferModeBlend;
qtTargetMovie.QTControl.Movie.Tracks(3).OperationColor =3D =
"32768,32768,32768";
qtTargetMovie.QTControl.Movie.Tracks(3).HighQualityMode =3D true;

The first line is changing the location of the track, which it does just =
fine, so I know I have the right track addressed. The next line just =
doesn't seem to happen. The track is always set to Dither when I check =
the Movie Properties. I am using version 7.6.6 of QT on Windows.

I also tried:

qtTargetMovie.QTControl.Movie.Tracks(3).TransferMode =3D =
QTTransferModesEnum.qtTransferModeStraighAlphaBlend;

I'm using the book "QuickTime For .NET and COM Developers" by John =
Cromie as my reference (which is excellent, btw).
