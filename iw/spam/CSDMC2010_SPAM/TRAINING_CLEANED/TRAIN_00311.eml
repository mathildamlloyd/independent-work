So, do you have the two VGA cards enabled? I also have an Intel embedded 
card but IIRC, I disabled it in the BIOS as soon as I plugged the nvidia 
card (7600 GS).

OTOH, it seems that device ID corresponds to nvida 9400 GT. So I would 
test with the nvidia Debian drivers. If they do not work, you can always 
come back and activate the Intel one.
