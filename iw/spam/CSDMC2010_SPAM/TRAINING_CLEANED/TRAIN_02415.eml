None[SAtalk] O.T. Habeus -- Why?-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I may be dense, but why would anyone want to utilize Habeus?  To me, it looks 
like a potential backdoor to anyone's defenses against spam.

If I were a spammer, I'd simply set up a server, send out my spam with the 
Habeus headers and continue till I was reasonably certain I'd been reported.  
Then I'd simply reconfigure the server and reconnect to a different IP.  As 
long as no one can establish my connection to the web sites my spam is 
directing people to, I'm home free.

Since I can set up spamassassin to I don't "lose" any email, what do I gain 
by making it easier for spam to get through??
