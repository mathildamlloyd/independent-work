I figured I would pipe up here, because I have a kind of different
perspective here. I have a 42U data center rack in my basement, and about
half a dozen really old servers. They aren't really worth much from a
financial standpoint, but at the same time, I use them as a sort of test
lab. and I have a Tripp Lite 1000VA and an APC BackUPS 1000 (just replaced
the batteries) in the rack. I also have a BackUPS 350 for my workstation.

It's not about the cost of the hardware (as I said, almost everything is 32
bit PIII/P4 class hardware that has little to no value in most business
environments (which is how I came by it, by and large), but my data? Thats a
whole nother kettle of fish. It may only be important to me, but the point
is that it *is* important to me.
