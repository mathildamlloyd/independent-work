Backporting KDE4 applications to a KDE3 working environment is beyond 
my skills. I can't even get Squeeze KDM to use a different background 
as it is.

Going back to obsequious pandering is looking very tempting. Yes, us 
mere users have nothing to contribute, since we don't write code.

Indeed. And I assure you, that fact is not lost on anyone.
