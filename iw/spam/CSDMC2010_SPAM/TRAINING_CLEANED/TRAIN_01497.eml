NoneHow to get kdict or aequivalent in KDE4 / Squeeze?Hi folks,

a few days ago I've upgraded my Debian from Lenny to Squeeze. My
problem: the beloved kdict with the small input-field in the kicker are
not there anymore. I am missing it:-(
What can I do to get access with such a small input-field to my local
dictd?


ciao, Dirk
