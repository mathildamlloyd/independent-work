Here is the bug I opened:

  http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=762

RBLs have the same problem, but there is no negative RBL header rule
with a -20 score that can be forged, so the problem is unique to Habeas.

My primary issue is the magnitude of the negative score and that it was
not determined empirically.  I am also concerned that it was added after
the rules freeze, that such a major change was not discussed in advance,
etc.

There's also no evidence that the rule will actually reduce FPs.  People
who are smart enough to use the rule are probably capable of writing
email that doesn't look like spam (I'm not counting spam mailing lists
which you need to be exempted from spam filtering).

there's also no evidence that the rule will actually reduce fps.  people
who are smart enough to use the rule are probably capable of writing
email that doesn't look like spam (i'm not counting spam mailing lists
which you need to be exempted from spam filtering).
