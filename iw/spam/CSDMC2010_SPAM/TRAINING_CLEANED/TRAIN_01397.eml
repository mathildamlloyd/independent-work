re: augd: displaying ipad at a meeting, what doesn't workyep.  when i did the iphone demo a couple years back we duck-taped my video camera to the arm of a boom mike, pointed it down at a flat surface, hooked the video camera up to the projector, and did it that way.  took a bit of finagling the light and angles so everything was visible.
