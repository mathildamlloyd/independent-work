NoneDaemonsI have several running daemons  that write some data to files
What happens with these open files when INIT 6 command  is issued?
Are these files that are used by daemons deleted? Or are they closed regularly and saved ?
And what happens, if the  Linux box is shut down in a dirty way( out of electricity)?
Thanks
L.
