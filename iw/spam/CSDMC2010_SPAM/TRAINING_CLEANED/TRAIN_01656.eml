Noneusb raid1 pendrive bootDid anyone managed to boot from RAID1?

Lenny gives this error message:

"mdadm: no devices found for /dev/md0"

I just want to install Debian Lenny on two pendrives [in sRAID1], so
that the HDD's in the pc can be used only as ""data containers"", but it
gives this error message.

Please help me.

Thank you!
