TROUBLESHOOTING VOICE | By Tom Lancaster

When you're troubleshooting voice calls, particularly the signaling,
it's often helpful to look at the detailed output of the device, be
it a voice-enabled router, telephony server, gateway or whatever. 
This detailed output can be in the form of logs or debug output as is
the case in Cisco's IOS.  In any case, this output is likely to be
somewhat cryptic.  One of the reasons is because this output often
uses a set of standardized codes and it is simply easier to put more
information on the screen using a short number than it is to write an
essay about why some event happened.

VoIP ENABLE YOUR TELEPHONY | By Tom Lancaster

One of the reasons VoIP has been slowly gaining traction is that
large enterprises have quite a lot of legacy equipment, and migrating
to VoIP from the circuit-switched networks of yore is no easy feat.
These environments are typically complicated and the stakes are high
because so many mission-critical systems rely on telephony.

UNDERSTANDING RELAY | By Tom Lancaster

Everyone knows that delay is one of the two primary causes of poor
voice quality, particularly in VoIP networks, but where does this
delay come from?  Delay is generally defined as the time it takes
from the instant you speak into the phone until the instant that
sound is regenerated on the far end. Quite a few things have to
happen to transport this sound through the system, so delay actually
has many components.
