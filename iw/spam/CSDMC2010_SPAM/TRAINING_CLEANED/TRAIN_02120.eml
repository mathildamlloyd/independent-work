Ah, in Spanish. Curious :-). Yes, so it translates.

Yes... I would report. But also take a look into this:

Connect HP 50g (or HP 49g+) to a Linux Box with hptalx
http://bleedux.wordpress.com/2010/03/11/connect-hp-50g-to-a-linux-box-with-hptalx/

And see if that helps. It seems to be written for ArchLinux (another 
linux distribution) but it points some interesting things that you can 
check.
