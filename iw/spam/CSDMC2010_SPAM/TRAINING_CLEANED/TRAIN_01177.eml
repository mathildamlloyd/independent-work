"License" and/or patents are very important if you want to distribute 
your work and W3C should care about recommending a technology or 
specification that may have a non-clear license or make use of hidden 
patended software.

I still remember the Eolas issue that hit Internet Explorer ;-)

What I wanted to say is that in the event I had to choose a format for 
delivering my work, I -for sure- wouldn't go for Flash, although Adobe 
claims is "open".

OTOH, as many others have pointed out, Flash format maybe now open, but 
"players" are still in a very bad shape (and I am not talking about Gnash/
swfdec, but Adobe's own flash player for linux). It's crappy and buggy.

So the reality is that anyone wanting to view a flash based site has to 
have Adobe Flash player installed as is the only one able to fully 
support all the features listed in their "open" specs.

And the same situation goes for Adobe Reader for Linux. I dunno what is 
going on with Adobe but true is that I dislike the path is taking that 
company :-/
