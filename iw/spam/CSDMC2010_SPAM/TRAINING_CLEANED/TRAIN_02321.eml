NoneXterm crashes when UTF-8 is enabledShortly after I turn UTF-8 on xterm will crash for no apparent reason. =
It doesn't have to be UTF-8 characters. Simply turn on UTF-8 and do =
"find /" and there it goes. I can reproduce this 100% of the time.

(If this is not the right list for this, a pointer to the right list =
would be appreciated.)
