I do have the following as part of my sources.conf:

deb http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile lenny/volatile main
contrib non-free
deb-src http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile lenny/volatile main
contrib non-free
deb http://www.debian-multimedia.org lenny main

I am not sure if I actually installed anything from volatile.

Yes, from debian-multimedia.org. Presumably that counts as non-Debian.

Sorry to sound stupid, but how do I activate those? Right now I don't
see any icons on the desktop when plugging devices in.

Yes, the pmount works fine now, it did not even require setting anything up.

Thanks for showing and explaining lshal to me. I'll explore with it and
report if I find something interesting.
