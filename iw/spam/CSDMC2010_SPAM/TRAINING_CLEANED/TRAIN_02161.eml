Johnny U: Johnny Unitas was the National Football League's most valuable
player twice - and he led Baltimore to victory in "Super Bowl Five."
For those of you younger than 30: this WAS modern football.  The game
was played on artificial turf. (Richard Burkard/

Announcement: How telling is it that the death of Johnny Unitas was
announced by the Baltimore Ravens - and not the Colts, who now play in
Indianapolis?  When the Colt owners moved out of Baltimore years ago,
they apparently left all the history books behind. (Burkard)

Dick Disappears: Vice President Dick Cheney remains at an undisclosed
location.  The move is for security reasons.  The Bush Administration
is trying to keep him at a safe distance from would-be subpoenas. (Alan

Noelle Nabbed: Jeb Bush's daughter Noelle is in trouble with the law
again.  When she was a child, her dad would read her favorite bedtime
story.  Goldilocks and the Three Strikes. (Ray)
