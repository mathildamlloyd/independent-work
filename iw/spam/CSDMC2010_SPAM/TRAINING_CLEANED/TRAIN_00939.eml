None[SAtalk] OT: DNS MX Record Clarification Please
This may be a little off topic but thought people here would have a better
response to this elsewhere.

I have setup two MX records (mail and bmail) for my mail server. The one I
gave a 10 (bmail) the other a 20 (mail).

bmail(10) I gave a 10 because I want all mail to go through this server to
be scanned for SPAM and viruses and then relayed to the mail(20) server for
delivery.

As I understand it, DNS A records are used in a rotating fashion for load
balancing, but DNS MX records are used in order or prority, meaning the 10
before the 20 and only 20 if the 10 isn't available.

But only some of the mail is actually being scanned which leads me to
believe that not all of the mail is actually hitting that box and the 10
never goes down. Why? Have I got something confused here?

Thanks,
V
