The imho more interesting point is: What does it mean in the long term?
The current situation is: 
Volatile has clamav 0.95, while upstream has 0.96.  There are security related 
issues in 0.95 (DoS etc.?) [1] that might affect(?) volatile - futhermore the 
clamav-people are suggesting to use the latest version [2] - that is 0.96.
Volatile itself is not supported by the security team [3] and the security 
team refuses the support the current stable version [4].

As a sysop running lenny/clamav on a few hosts, I started building clamav from 
source and reading clamav's announce list.
But I wonder, what does it mean in the long run:
- Will volatile be updated to 0.96 soon?
- Will clamav (in volatile) receive official security support?
- Are there any (better supported) alternatives to clamav in lenny?
- Afair there is no specific EOL-/Kill-Switch in clamav: ClamAV <= 0.94 is 
unable to handle "big" incremental updates and a "too" big update was 
shipped. Is it - from a naive point of view - just a bug that can be fixed in 
debian [5]? Just apply the given patch [6] in lenny's clamav and be 
happy? ;-)

Thanks,
