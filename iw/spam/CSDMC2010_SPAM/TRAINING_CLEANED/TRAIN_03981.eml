Mmmm, and there are others that think this is not enough:

the Sorenson Spark Codec that is used for video encoding in Flash 6 and

but, without them, the information that Adobe has released is of limited

As per the above link, it seems not all the specs have been released or 
made publicly available. There are also some concerns about software 
patents (for using -and distributing- MP3 codecs or FLV).

Anyway, I agree with your "hidden demand" ;-)

Look at PDF. PDF became a ISO/IEC standard but we (at linux) still lack 
for a PDF editor that can compete with Acrobat Professional.
