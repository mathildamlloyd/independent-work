[IMG: http://www.craphound.com/images/curlinggame.jpg] An Alberta teenager has 
hit the bigtime with a curling videogame. Friends of mine who curl assure me 
that curling is way fun to play (it certainly isn't that fun to watch!) and, of 
course, you can (and should!) drink beer while playing. I believe that 
disqualifies it as a sport, no? Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thaanks, Chris!_)
