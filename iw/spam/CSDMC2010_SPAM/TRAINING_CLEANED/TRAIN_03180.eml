I have one that uses dist to send stuff from my work mail to my 
home mail.  The binding looks like this:

set {bindings(key,HD_Dist_Silently -form distcomps.to-me)} <Meta-dollar>

The "HD_Dist_Silently" is a hacked up version of the proc that 
does dist in exmh and is pasted in below.  It's getting old and 
probably should be "resynced" with the current code.  But it 
still works (on a relatively recent CVS copy of exmh)

It's also possible that there's an easier way but I hacked this 
together quickly a year or more ago and when it worked I moved 
on to other tasks.

--Hal

proc HD_Dist_Silently { args } {

    global exmh msg
    set exmh(ctype) {dist}
    if {[string length $args] == 0} {
	set args Mh_DistSetup
    }

    if [MsgOk $msg(id) m] {
	if {[string compare [info command $args] $args] == 0} {
	    # Old interface with hook procedure
	    if [catch {$args $exmh(folder) $m} err] {   ;# Setup draft msg
		Exmh_Status "${args}: $err" purple
		return
	    }
	}  else {
	    if [catch {
		Exmh_Status "dist +$exmh(folder) $m"
		eval {MhExec dist +$exmh(folder) $m} -nowhatnowproc $args
		MhAnnoSetup $exmh(folder) $m dist
	    } err] {
		Exmh_Status "dist: $err" purple
		return
	    }
	}
        Edit_Done send				;# Just send it
    }
}
