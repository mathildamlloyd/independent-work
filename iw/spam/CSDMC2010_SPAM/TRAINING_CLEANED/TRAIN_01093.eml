NoneSecurity update for Debian Testing - 2010-04-23This automatic mail gives an overview over security issues that were recently 
fixed in Debian Testing. The majority of fixed packages migrate to testing 
from unstable. If this would take too long, fixed packages are uploaded to the 
testing-security repository instead. It can also happen that vulnerable 
packages are removed from Debian testing.

Migrated from unstable:
=======================
couchdb 0.11.0-1:
CVE-2010-0009: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-0009
               http://bugs.debian.org/576304

liboggplay 0.2.1~git20091227-1.1:

               http://bugs.debian.org/575743

mediawiki 1:1.15.3-1:
CVE-2010-1150: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1150

How to update:
--------------
Make sure the line

	deb http://security.debian.org squeeze/updates main contrib non-free

is present in your /etc/apt/sources.list. Of course, you also need the line
pointing to your normal squeeze mirror. You can use

	aptitude update && aptitude dist-upgrade

to install the updates.
