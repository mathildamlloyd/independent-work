Yes, the Linux Documentation project is good too.  I go there mainly
for the HOWTOs if I want to research a specific subject.  But for
how to perform typical daily computing tasks using Linux, The Linux
Cookbook is the best that I have found.

"Oh, you want to do that?  Here, type this ..."

That's the kind of everyday usage question that the Linux Cookbook was
designed to solve.  And the second edition is even better.
Unfortunately, it's not available online.  But I liked the original
so well that I bought a hard copy of the second edition.
