Yes, I looked at "fixing" it there, but that code is really quite
general, with almost no understanding of what anything means, so I
didn't think that corrupting it with knowlwedge of the semantics of
what it is fetching would really be the best thing to do.

I ran out of time last night while looking for a better place for
a similar check (I would have gone directly to the regexp - I'm not
that up to date with all the latest tcl changes...) and I'm not sure
I will have time today, but I will keep looking.
