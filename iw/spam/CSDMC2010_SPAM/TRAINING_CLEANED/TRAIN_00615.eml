None> The 'box' shows up if you use xev -rv.  So my guess is that it is there, but just white on white (I'm using the default SL X11 2.3.5).

This is true. Even if you don't see the box, moving the mouse over its 
invisible border shows corresponding events.

Looks like a bug, but not in xev, because running xev via ssh on a 
remote machine doesn't show the box either. I am running standard SL 
10.6.3 X11 "XQuartz 2.3.5 (xorg-server 1.4.2-apple53)".
