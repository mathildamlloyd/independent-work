One practice I've adopted is to list Requires: only when they're
absolutely necessary.  This will help because some packages are named
differently between distributions (eg. SDL <-> libSDL), and the
dependencies are automatically handled by RPM by depending on shared
library names.

This doesn't apply to BuildRequires: though.

Use macros for directory names where available, eg %{_libdir},
%{_bindir}, %{_datadir} etc.

I'd like to suggest using as many RPM macros for command names as
possible too, but unfortunately I don't know of a definitive reference
about them...

I have a small RedHat 7.3 RPM/apt repository at
<http://cachalot.ods.org/>, and I've received reports from people
running Mandrake 8.x and SuSE that the RPMs work with them out of the
box.
