This should also have caused lilo to be run, if the customization
is correct.  There are only two or three lines of output from
lilo; so it's easy to overlook.

I found this thread on the internet.  I don't know if it's
your problem, but it's worth looking at.  I always use GNOME,
so I have no experience with messing with .xinitrc:

At this point, you only have two kernels installed; so there's nothing to
purge right now.  But be sure to add the optional flag to the LinuxOld
section in /etc/lilo.conf.  Without it, lilo will generate an error if
there are not at least two kernels installed.

Well, I already have, sort of.  The trouble is that it's buried in a
larger document on custom kernel building.  People see that and think,
"Oh, I'm not building a custom kernel; so I don't need to read this."
But Step 10 on my kernel building page

   http://www.wowway.com/~zlinuxman/Kernel.htm

talks about customizing the kernel installation environment, and that
part is applicable to both stock and custom kernels.  The instructions
for customizing the Lenny environment work for Squeeze also, provided
that you use *only* stock kernels.  The minute you introduce a custom
kernel, you *must* use the hook scripts, as documented in the Squeeze
section.

As I explained in another post, yes, it is in Sid.  If you need
instructions for how to pull in the Sid kernel without upgrading
your whole system to Sid, let me know and I can provide that.
Also, you might try disabling ACPI and try the vesa driver,
as explained in another post.
