None[ILUG] Mutt reply hooks
Hi all,

I have 3 or 4 email addresses (which get used for different
reasons), and I'd prefer not to mix them up. So I was wondering
if anyone knows of a way that I can have mail (apart from list
mail, which I have already sorted) which arrives to a certain
e-mail address have the From: header in the reply automatically
set to the address it came to.

For example, say I have a company, and sales@company.com,
info@company.com and tech@company.com arrive in the same mailbox.
I don't want to reply to sales@company.com mails with the From:
set to dave@company.com, I would like the mail to come from
sales@company.com.

Is there any way to do this? Bearing in mind that mail can arrive
with my email in the To or Cc fields (and Bcc?), and it might be
buried in a couple of dozen other recipients...

Cheers,
Dave.
