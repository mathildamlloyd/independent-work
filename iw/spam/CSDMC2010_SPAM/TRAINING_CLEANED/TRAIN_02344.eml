NoneDoes QTVisualContextCopyImageForTime block?The documentation isn't clear, will QTVisualContextCopyImageForTime() =
block or just return nil if the data isn't there yet.

I'm iterating a movie frame by frame from a secondary thread. Rather =
than polling/spinning on QTVisualContextIsNewImageAvailable() for each =
frame, can I just CopyImageForTime() and let it block until the data is =
available? The alternative is to install a hook via =
QTVisualContextSetImageAvailableCallback() and trigger a semaphore, but =
blocking on the Copy call would be much more straightforward.

Thanks!
