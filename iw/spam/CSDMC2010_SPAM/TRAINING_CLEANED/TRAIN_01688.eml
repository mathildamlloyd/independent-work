NoneHow can I initialize a QTMovie object with certain attributes using
 writable data?Hello all,

I'm trying to create an empty QTMovie object that I can add segments to, 
and then play. This is easy to do with something like:

movie = [[QTMovie alloc] initToWritableData:[NSMutableData 
dataWithCapacity:1048576] error:&error];

I can then use -insertSegmentOfMovie to insert segments from other 
movies into this one so I can play it back. The problem is that I also 
need to set a certain attribute when creating the QTMovie object. In 
particular, I need to set the QTMovieRateChangesPreservePitchAttribute 
attribute, so that I can alter playback speed during playback without 
changing pitch. This attribute cannot be written after the movie is 
initialized.

So, I can create the QTMovie object like this:

movie = [[QTMovie alloc] initWithAttributes:[NSDictionary 
dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:[NSNumber numberWithBool:YES], 
QTMovieRateChangesPreservePitchAttribute, nil] error:&error];

Unfortunately, this is not editable. I've tried setting the 
QTMovieEditableAttribute as well on creation, but it does not help. I 
still get an exception when I try to insert anything into this movie. I 
presume this is because there is no writable file or data reference 
associated with the QTMovie.

Any ideas on how to solve this?

Thanks very much,
Chad Sellers

how can i initialize a qtmovie object with certain attributes using
 writable data?hello all,

i'm trying to create an empty qtmovie object that i can add segments to, 
and then play. this is easy to do with something like:

movie = [[qtmovie alloc] inittowritabledata:[nsmutabledata 
datawithcapacity:1048576] error:&error;];

i can then use -insertsegmentofmovie to insert segments from other 
movies into this one so i can play it back. the problem is that i also 
need to set a certain attribute when creating the qtmovie object. in 
particular, i need to set the qtmovieratechangespreservepitchattribute 
attribute, so that i can alter playback speed during playback without 
changing pitch. this attribute cannot be written after the movie is 
initialized.

so, i can create the qtmovie object like this:

movie = [[qtmovie alloc] initwithattributes:[nsdictionary 
dictionarywithobjectsandkeys:[nsnumber numberwithbool:yes], 
qtmovieratechangespreservepitchattribute, nil] error:&error;];

unfortunately, this is not editable. i've tried setting the 
qtmovieeditableattribute as well on creation, but it does not help. i 
still get an exception when i try to insert anything into this movie. i 
presume this is because there is no writable file or data reference 
associated with the qtmovie.

any ideas on how to solve this?

thanks very much,
