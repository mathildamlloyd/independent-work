Quite some modules from CPAN do have a line like this nowadays (I think or 
read so somewhere, respectively). And the Perl error message is very clear: 
"ExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at 
Makefile.PL line 2."

I could think of a solution: We could remove the "use" line and add the 
version to PREREQ_PM. After WriteMakefile() we could add the lines 
  require ExtUtils::MakeMaker; 
  ExtUtils::MakeMaker->VERSION(5.45); 
to do per hand what 'use ExtUtils::MakeMaker 5.45' does automagically; `perl 
Makefile.PL` will die with a "Uncaught exception from user code: 
ExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at 
Makefile.PL line 103." there but we've got a Makefile. But I don't know if 
CPAN will run the make anyway...

We could call the preprocessor on install time. That's not a very clean 
approach but could work. 
 
We can also overwrite pm_to_blib in the Makefile directly per postamble. We 
already have a useless line "pm_to_blib: spamassassin doc/.made" there. Adding 
some commands in this section gives some make warnings ("Makefile:933: 
warning: overriding commands for target `pm_to_blib' Makefile:877: warning: 
ignoring old commands for target `pm_to_blib'") but does work. Not a very good 
solution either.

The "use MakeMaker::..." error message is IMHO quite clear, so I think it's ok 
to require the user to do a manual update of ExtUtils::MakeMaker before the SA 
installation. But that's just my opinion ;-) 
 
I'll ask on makemaker@perl.org for the best solution. They should know.

quite some modules from cpan do have a line like this nowadays (i think or 
read so somewhere, respectively). and the perl error message is very clear: 
"extutils::makemaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at 
makefile.pl line 2."

i could think of a solution: we could remove the "use" line and add the 
version to prereq_pm. after writemakefile() we could add the lines 
  require extutils::makemaker; 
  extutils::makemaker->version(5.45); 
to do per hand what 'use extutils::makemaker 5.45' does automagically; `perl 
makefile.pl` will die with a "uncaught exception from user code: 
extutils::makemaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at 
makefile.pl line 103." there but we've got a makefile. but i don't know if 
cpan will run the make anyway...

we can also overwrite pm_to_blib in the makefile directly per postamble. we 
already have a useless line "pm_to_blib: spamassassin doc/.made" there. adding 
some commands in this section gives some make warnings ("makefile:933:

the "use makemaker::..." error message is imho quite clear, so i think it's ok 
to require the user to do a manual update of extutils::makemaker before the sa 
installation. but that's just my opinion ;-) 
 
i'll ask on makemaker@perl.org for the best solution. they should know.
