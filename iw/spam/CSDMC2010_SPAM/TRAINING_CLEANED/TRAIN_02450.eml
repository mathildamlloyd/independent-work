Don't run SA on mails this large. Most people tend to ignore mails 
larger than about 250K in spamassassin processing, because it just kills 
performance. There are some known issues with the parsing (such as the 
HTML parsing stuff which is much improved in 2.40 which we're soon to 
release), but nothing that's too likely to be fixed by 2.40. Perhaps in 
2.50 though.

Matt.
