I think it's fine, in general, just so long as no-one checks in anything
that puts it into my test corpus.

Or alternately, whatever is chosen should be ignored by the tokenizer. 
I know my mail host (interlink) runs SA, but I also run it, with my own
set of rules and scores. I don't want my spam-filter to be getting messed
up by an upstream spam filter.
