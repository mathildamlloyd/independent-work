NoneAnyone have a copy of Gill Sans or Bell Centennial I can borrow? I wonder if 
I'll ever have $250 to spend on fonts. *Update:* Kevin Marks[1], who is 
stupendously incredible for far more things than I can list here points out 
that it's _included with OS X_. I knew Mac OS X included a lot of grat fonts[2]
, but I don't know how I overlooked this. (Matthew Carter, I'd be happy to pay 
you the two cents in royalties you probably get for selling $100 worth of 
fonts.) 

Tufte notes: Terrie Miller[3]. 

First ammendement beer bash. 

iSync Beta[4] (guess they learned a lesson from iCal) is out.
