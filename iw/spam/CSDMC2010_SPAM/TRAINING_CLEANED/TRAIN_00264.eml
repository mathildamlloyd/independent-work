is around the corner. If you are seeing problems, download the latest
version; most likely the problem has been fixed already, if not, send a
bug report to razor-testers@lists.sf.net or to chad@cloudmark.com

re: [razor-users] authentication errorat this instance there are several thousand happy users of the razor v2
system. the code is still officially in beta, but the first stable release
is around the corner. if you are seeing problems, download the latest
version; most likely the problem has been fixed already, if not, send a
bug report to razor-testers@lists.sf.net or to chad@cloudmark.com

cheers,
vipul.
