Nothing really interesting there. Just:

==
AUDIT: Tue May 18 18:01:04 2010: 3716 X: client 33 rejected from local host (uid 0)
  Auth name: MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 ID: -1
==
but 18:01:24 seems to be when I asked to restart gdm.

Note that I do not think that X crashed entirely. I just mean that the

moving... slowly, or sometimes really slowly.
