Yes.  The X server is completely secondary, and I don't think Apple Java
interacts with it at all.

Right.

If you are using AWT, you need to give your program access to the
console.  Apple uses a Mach-involved security model of namespaces to
control access to various things; you can find more information on it at
http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/technotes/tn2005/tn2083.html.
Worth reading.  Several times.

But the pertinent bit is ``A process can only use the global window
server service if its EUID is 0 (it's running as root) or matches the
UID of the console user. All other users are barred from using it.''

I don't see an update of this document for 10.6, either.

You could try installing another Java that includes a client Xlib
implementation, and go from there.  Or, of course, run your program on
Linux or FreeBSD or OpenSolaris instead.

if you are using awt, you need to give your program access to the
console.  apple uses a mach-involved security model of namespaces to
control access to various things; you can find more information on it at
