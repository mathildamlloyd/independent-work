Noneaccomplish a specific end; dumping truckload after truckload of bad acts
proves their point: stupidity and greed typify government, therefore any
government is too much government.

Yes, you read the links.

Sorry, but exposing folly is not only humorous but also instructive.  It
is only by exposing folly to ridicule that you stop it in the first
place.

'Brickbats' leans heavily on both, though the item I highlighted was a
'horror' item not a 'gee that is stupid' item.  For an example of the
latter, see the city that wanted a woman to pay a ticket for parking in
an UNmarked no-parking space.

re: our friends the palestinians, our servants in government.when brickbats or fox exposes the folly of government they do so to
accomplish a specific end; dumping truckload after truckload of bad acts
proves their point: stupidity and greed typify government, therefore any
government is too much government.
