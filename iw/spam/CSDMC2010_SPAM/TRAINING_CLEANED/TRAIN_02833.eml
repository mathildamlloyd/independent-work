I.


 From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
But as the riper should by time decease,
His tender heir might bear his memory:
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content
And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.
      Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
      To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

Shakespeare, William.  Sonnets.

William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was a famous English poet,
dramatist, and actor, often regarded as the greatest English
writer of all time. Shakespeare's early life was spent in
Stratford-upon-Avon, where little else is known about him
until he married at age 18 to Anne Hathaway.  He enjoyed
quick recognition as a skilled playwright in London as a
member of the Lord Chamberlain's Company (also known as the
King's Men).  He retired in 1610, having spent a successful
career as a writer and heralded by royalty and peasants
alike.

Shakespeare's privacy resulted in a sketchy timeline of the
writer's life, leading many over the years to attempt to
fill in the gaps, often with scraps of fact and fiction that
only result in nothing close to the truth (A truth we will
probably never know).  Among the rumors and hypotheses
offered over the years: that he was gay; a womanizer;
illiterate (reciting his works to a scribe), and a puppet
(in which he didn't write the works but was encouraged to
take credit to shield the real writer -- a person with
political ties).

Shakespeare's sonnets give readers a glimpse into the mind
and heart of the playwright.  Published in 1609, the 154
sonnets involve the author's relationship with various
characters, including a striking young man, a mysterious
woman, and a rival poet.  The identities of the characters
have also been the subject of much speculation over the
years, despite the fact that they may have been completely
created in the mind of the bard.
