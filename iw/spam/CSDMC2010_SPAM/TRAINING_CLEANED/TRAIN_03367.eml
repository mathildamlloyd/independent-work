What release of Debian are you using?  Lenny?  Squeeze?  Sid?

I've experienced what you describe before, mainly because older releases
of Debian used the lpr/lpd printing setup, and I used apsfilter to
install printer drivers.  Then when I switched to a newer release of
Debian that used CUPS, and foomatic did not have a driver for the printer,
especially for older or less popular printers.

http://www.linuxprinting.org and http://www.cups.org are good places
to start looking for documentation.
