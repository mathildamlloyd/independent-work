NoneWould reinitializing something here help, or does razor do that as needed
anyway, and this just reflects trouble at the servers?

Also, since these are reports I'm making from within Mutt, it's annoying
that the error messages garble the X window a bit. If there's nothing
constructive to do about razor failing, can I at least turn off the failure
messages? One way or the other I'd rather not see them.
