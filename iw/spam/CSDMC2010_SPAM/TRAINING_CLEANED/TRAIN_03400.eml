So far most of the "discussion" has been whining about where KDE 4 is=20
perceived to be worse than KDE 3.5 and whining that "somebody should please=
=20
do something".

If the discussion starts to get positive and deals with stuff like who will=
=20
do what and where to host the new packages until they can be uploaded etc.,=
=20
this kind of whining about what discussions should or should not be held=20
will probably stop quite soon.  (At least from my side.)
