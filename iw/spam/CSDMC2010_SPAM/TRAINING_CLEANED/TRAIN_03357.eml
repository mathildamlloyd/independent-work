None[Razor-users] Re: No results from razor-check on known spam?It's got to be razor 2.x...I've never installed razor 1.x <G>

However:

[mburger@burgers mburger]$ razor-report -v
Razor Agents 2.14, protocol version 3

As to more details...I don't have any...it runs, seems to do its thing, 
and then gives that error.
