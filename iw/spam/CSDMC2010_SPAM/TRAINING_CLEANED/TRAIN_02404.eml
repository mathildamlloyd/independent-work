Hi,

I have the Huawei E1762 usb dongle running under Lenny and Squeeze
using pppd as were I live I have no access to dsl or cable.

With Lenny you need to install the the kernel 2.6.30 from Debian
backports[1] first, as the 2.6.28 kernels onwards will flip flop the
device for you. At the moment it maybe just being picked up as a mass
storage device and not a modem if you still using the 2.6.26 kernel.
And if you want to stay with the 2.6.26 kernel you will have to
install usb-modeswitch[3].

Setting up wvdial this might help you[2].


Regards
Dale
