NoneI did try just cvs'ing over the existing sources, but cvs complained that my 
files were in the way.

Then I thought that I'd only need the DRI stuff, that took about 1.5 hours to 
fetch 116M. Unfortunately I still need the XFree86 cvs stuff as well :-( At 
339M that took almost 3 hours.

Now I can start building the XFree86 cvs and DRI cvs stuff for testing the 3D 
patches for my GVX1 card. I just hope I don't completely trash my system in 
the process. 

Think I'll wait until morning to start building, though. I've been building a 
new box from source this week. A 200Mhz PentiumMMX with 96M. It took a full 
day to build XFree86 4.2.0 and 2.5 days each to build qtlibs and kdelibs. 
kdebase took just under 46 hours. I've got lots of grief from the wife for 
the computer running 'round the clock this week. The rest of KDE should build 
in under 20 hour increments.

Cheers,

re: [ilug] cvs question?well, as many have said, it's non-trivial and not smart enough.

i did try just cvs'ing over the existing sources, but cvs complained that my 
files were in the way.

then i thought that i'd only need the dri stuff, that took about 1.5 hours to 
fetch 116m. unfortunately i still need the xfree86 cvs stuff as well :-( at 
339m that took almost 3 hours.

now i can start building the xfree86 cvs and dri cvs stuff for testing the 3d 
patches for my gvx1 card. i just hope i don't completely trash my system in 
the process.
