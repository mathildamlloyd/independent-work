Every week, we publish the Interactive <br>
TV Power Rankings. We rank the 10 companies<br>
that are benefiting most from the deployment<br>
of new TV technology. <br>
<br>
This week's highlights:<br>
Will the FCC approve the Echostar-DIRECTV<br>
merger?; why did Cox scale back its Video<br>
on Demand plans?; why did Liberty Media buy<br>
a cable company in the Netherlands?; and <br>
who at NBC is smoking crack?<br>

TiVo: Now or Never?

Ready for this?<br>
<br>
The next five months could determine whether<br> 
TiVo, the Personal Video Recorder service,<br>
ultimately survives as a business.<br>
<br>
TiVo, which launched five years ago, has less <br>
than 500,000 subscribers. The company's stock<br>
dipped below three this week. And network execs<br>
are openly questioning whether the digital recorder,<br>
which permits skipping commercials with a few <br>
clicks of the remote, will destroy their advertising<br>
models. There even have been hints that the <br>
networks could support a move by the cable <br>
industry to offer a PVR that does not permit<br>
commercial skipping. And that PVR would not <br>
be a TiVo. <br>
<br>
To its credit, TiVo has been remarkably successful <br>
at building brand loyalty and awareness. TiVo <br>
reports that 97 percent of its subscribers have<br>
recommended the service to a friend. And when<br>
people talk about PVRs, they say TiVo. (Just <br>
like the way people say "Coke" when they talk<br>
about soft drinks. )<br>
<br>
But Wall Street, the media and the industry <br>
are all growing impatient. TiVo needs to start<br>
putting some big numbers on the board -- <br>
and it needs to do it this holiday season. If <br>
it doesn't, stock analysts who have supported TiVo <br>
until now will run for the hills. That will push<br>
the company's stock price down even further. And<br>
if that happens, TiVo could have just two choices:<br>
Sell the company under duress or wait until its <br>
funding dries up. <br>
<br>
Consequently, I predict that TiVo will launch <br>
an intensive marketing blitz over the next <br>
five months, right through the holiday season.<br>
The blitz will include a sharp increase in <br>
retail distribution, TV advertising and PR <br>
efforts. The company needs to show Wall <br>
Street -- and the industry -- that it will be <br>
the brand leader in the PVR category. And it<br>
needs to show that it can generate<br>
mass consumer demand. <br>
<br>
How does TiVo demonstrate that?<br>
<br>
Anything short of 750,000 subs at year's end<br>
will have people questioning whether TiVo has<br>
the right stuff. Cable execs, who are watching<br>
TiVo closely, might decide that adding the <br>
service is not such a great selling point <br>
after all. And Echostar, which currently does<br>
not have an agreement with TiVo, may decide<br>
to stay with its unbranded PVR service after <br>
its merger with DIRECTV is approved in D.C. <br>
(TiVo currently has a partnership with DIRECTV,<br>
but it's unclear what will happen to the deal if <br>
the merger is approved.) <br>
<br>
So there is much at stake -- and it's not extreme<br>
to say that TiVo's ultimate future could be decided<br>
in the next several months. <br>
<br>
Will it succeed? I predict that TiVo will achieve<br>
a partial success. The company will boost its <br>
subscriber numbers and it will maintain its claim<br>
as the #1 PVR service. However, in time, I <br>
also predict it will decide to sell the company<br>
to a large media outfit, such as Sony or perhaps<br>
even Liberty Media. This would give TiVo the <br>
necessary funding and industry connections<br>
for long-term growth and survival.<br>
