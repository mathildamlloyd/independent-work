PHP FLAW COULD CRASH, BURN WEB SERVERS | News: SearchSecurity
A security vulnerability in the popular PHP scripting language could
allow an attacker to crash a Web server or run arbitrary code on a
system. Only particular versions of PHP are impacted, and users are
urged to upgrade or patch immediately.

ensure that your firewall is configured for optimal performance and

THE MISSING LINK | Scot has cyber tomb with a view

Sometimes an epitaph just can't be the last word. Billy Kemp was a
great Scot who died a couple of years ago at the young age of 52. He
was a councilman, husband, father and pillar of his community. His
family couldn't possibly post all that on a tombstone. But they did
manage to fit http://www.billykemp.org.uk/ on there. Yep, Kemp's
tombstone doubles as a billboard for his Web site, created
posthumously by his son as a tribute to his father's life. The grave
site has gotten more than 33,000 hits, perhaps more visits than the
gravesite!
