SA (and other filters) could be configured to ignore the SWE mark if it 
appears to come from/through China.

SA could also be configured so that SWE marks are ignored in messages that 
look like third-party spam (like stock scams).  Of course, this would still

through.  Probably also need to ignore SWE in messages that look like 
Nigerian scams.
