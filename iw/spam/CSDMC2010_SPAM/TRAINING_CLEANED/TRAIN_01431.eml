In my experience, they do care.  It has to work certainly, and in
particular it has to work with what they've already got, and it has to
work on client's systems.

My limited experience of Java started a few years ago when support on
Linux was so terrible that I ran away screaming and haven't come back yet.

Microsoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows.
They took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a
service pack.  Somehow, I can't imagine them removing the ability to
run C programs.

If your problem just requires application of a "design pattern" to solve,
then it's trivial anyway irrespective of language.

You appear to be gratuitously asserting that C programmers waste time
on irrelevant low-level problems and Java programmers don't.  Depends
entirely on the programmer, not the language.

Dunno.  E.g., I ported a wee 15000-line C program to Darwin on PowerPC
in a few minutes yesterday.  Sure if it was badly designed it would be
10 times the size and harder to port.  If it depended on unavailable
libraries it would be much harder.  Portable code is easy to port.
At least that is the case when then language you used is available on
the target platform: I also run on ARM systems with no proper Java.

You can pay a good programmer to solve your problem now, or else get
some kids to hack spaghetti Fortran in any language and then pay for
maintenance headaches ad infinitum.

Whoah!!!  Performance matters to me every day.  (Right now I'm taking
time out to write email while waiting for a job to run).  Sure I could
wait 5 years until everyone's PC is fast enough to generate random EC's
in no time, when any twit will be able to program inefficient code
that is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitors,
or I can do it now when very few people can.

Yes.

It's true!  I admit everything!  Mea maxima culpa!  Working in C makes
me spend all day thinking base, rank thoughts about hard-core bitography!
Not.

Actually I spend most of my time thinking in high-level mathematics.

Dunno, and frankly I don't see the relevance to the issue at hand.


I'm sure Java is fine for some stuff, as is C or whatever.  Horses for
courses.
