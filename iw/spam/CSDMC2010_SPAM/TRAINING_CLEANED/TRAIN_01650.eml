NoneWhat needs to improve in KDE 4?Please tell us what problems, bugs, or issues KDE 4 that make it
difficult to use. Please be very specific so that bugs can be filed
and the software can be fixed. General statements such as "KDE4 sux"
are not welcome, as they do not give any indication as to what can be
fixed.

Comparisons to KDE 3 are welcome, but please do not simply state
"should be like KDE 3". Rather, please state how KDE 4 behaves, and
how you would prefer it to behave (even if that means describing in
detail KDE 3 behaviour).

My intention is to file issues and get bugs fixed, not to fight.
Nobody is ordered to participate in this thread, but all are welcome.
