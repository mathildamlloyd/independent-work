Was there any science in there? All I saw was more of the "myth of the 
liberal media." Every opinion supporting global warming was "the media", 
every opinion against it was an "expert." A brief perusal of the rest of 
the web site and I'm left wondering where the science
is.
And, to put on my extremist hat, every organization or scientist in 
there was American. Big deal - a bunch of scientists being trotted out 
to support government and industrial policy that is the ultimate source 
of their livelihood and research money. If the government changes their 
mind on Kyoto, they'll trot out another group of tame scientists. And 
all the American papers will switch back to warning us about climate change.
