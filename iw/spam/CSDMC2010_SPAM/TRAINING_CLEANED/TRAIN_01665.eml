the
    'Email My Password To Me' button.  List passwords will differ from

    mailing lists; if you contact our support staff, you must provide

to
    this mailing should be submitted as a Support Request at this URL:

    to request a reset of your list admin password.  Please include a
list
    of the mailing lists whose passwords you need reset.  No automated

Please note: As of 2002-08-20, this mailing will no longer include the
list management passwords for your subscriptions.  If you have lost
your list management password, you will need to recover those
passwords on a per-list basis as described in #2 of the UNSUBSCRIBE
section, above.
