NoneJumpy video after KDE 4.4 upgrade in SqueezeI upgraded my Squeeze box to KDE 4.4 about a week ago, and have been 
contending with jumpy, hesitant video performance ever since. I'm not sure 
which package to file this bug against; if it helps I'm running an Nvidia 
7900GS using the drivers in the nvidia-glx package. It ran fine with KDE 4.3. 
Thanks!
