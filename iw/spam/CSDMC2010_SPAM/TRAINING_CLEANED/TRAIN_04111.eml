As you do not explicitly request the font to be used, I expected latex 
to choose some other font instead. Does it work if you run the command 
update-updmap and try again?

Otherwise, I have two suggestions:

1) Send and email to the debian-tex mailing list 
(<http://lists.debian.org/debian-tex-maint/>). That list is the official 
maintainer address for texlive-base, according to 
(<http://packages.qa.debian.org/t/texlive-base.html>).

2) Report the problem as a bug. (<http://www.debian.org/Bugs/Reporting>).

Before doing any of those two, you should rewrite the example document 
to be as small and simple as possible (still showing the problem) and 
perhaps also translate the text to English.

Regards

otherwise, i have two suggestions:

1) send and email to the debian-tex mailing list 
(). that list is the official 
maintainer address for texlive-base, according to 
().

2) report the problem as a bug. ().

before doing any of those two, you should rewrite the example document 
to be as small and simple as possible (still showing the problem) and 
perhaps also translate the text to english.
