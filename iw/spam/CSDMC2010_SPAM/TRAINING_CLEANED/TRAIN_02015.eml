His screen shot seems to have a working dpkg.  It attempts to invoke the pr=
erm=20
scripts of a perl module.  That fails due to not being able to find=20
'File/Basename.pm', which causes dpkg to fail the --remove action with erro=
r=20
code 1.  apt-get then stops the install run.

Aptitude might get further than apt-get, but the prerm of the perl module i=
s=20
going to keep failing until perl is fixed.
