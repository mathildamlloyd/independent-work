Actually, the "x" permission on a directory means "search" (i.e. find =20=

a file in) the directory.  If you already know the name (or have =20
guessed it) of a file in the directory and you have "--x" (no-read, no-=20=

write, yes-search) on the directory and 'r--' (read-only) on the file, =20=

you can read the file even though you can't read the directory.  =20
That's a feature, and it dates back to early days in UNIX.

What you are seeing is a corner case caused by that feature.  If you =20
have "r--" on the directory you can read it, but you can't find any of =20=

the files whose names you can read.  So you can't get those files =20
permission bits or mod-time's etc.  So "ls" fails in the bizarre way =20
you are seeing.

So you can "read" the directory without the "x" bit, but it doesn't do =20=

you a fat load of good.

Enjoy!
