But I have to _look_ at them to turn them off.  In KDE 3 I do not.  I can t=

them off without ever having to see them.

They do not.  They are much more complicated than in KDE 3 and you have to=

No, it's alt+F1 in KDE 3.5.x.  Alt+F5, which I also like and use a lot, bri=

up a list of running windows.

But I don't _like_ KDE 4 and I do, very much, like KDE 3.  I like Kcontrol=

I have not evaded the question.  I have pointed out that I prefer things th=
