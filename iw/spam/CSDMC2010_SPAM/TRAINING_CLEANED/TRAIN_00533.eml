  If you see "aptitude safe-upgrade" trying to upgrade durep, I'd like
to see the output of these commands (after you type Control-C at the
aptitude prompt, of course):

aptitude show durep
aptitude -sy --show-resolver-actions safe-upgrade

  That shouldn't be possible.  If it is happening, something is very
wrong.  My own guess is that something is clearing your hold flags.  For
instance, it was recently pointed out to me that "aptitude keep-all"
clears hold flags (probably wrongly).
