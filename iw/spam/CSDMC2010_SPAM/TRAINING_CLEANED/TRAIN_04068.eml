I'm not sure what you mean. What is an "extra" iso?

You mean the full set of CD or DVD images? I find a net install works best 
nowadays. Then you just download and install packages as you want to.

The archive is simply huge now so it's a lot to download and burn unless you 
have machines that are not connected to the net that you want to install or 
update.
