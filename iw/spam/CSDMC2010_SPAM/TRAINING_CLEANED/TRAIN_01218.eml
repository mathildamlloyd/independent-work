                               stiffening sinews

         More hot summer days in the mailinglist alleyways,
         dangerously empty of sane postings, strewn with the rotting
         carcasses of broiling vacation messages. Hacktress and
         Silicon Valley's chief rat-keeper LILE ELAM, excitedly posts
         about a new open 802.11 network she's found. "I am here at
         the police station waiting to see a judge and I thought I
         would check to see if there is connectivity", she writes,
         somewhat recklessly, to the Bay Area Wireless list. Exit
         the rest of the Wifi community through the nearest window
         and out into the streets... where, cooling tempers, the
         Microsoft Palladium boys are on an endless summer tour,
         reassuring the experts that while, hmm, they *suppose* Pd
         could *theoretically* be used as a Hollywood DRM system,
         they truly have no plans to do any such thing. Cypherpunk
         and friend of freedom Lucky Green hears this; thinks up four
         or five of the obvious Palladium DRM implementations; sends
         them off to be patented in his name. Licensing funds, we
         imagine, will go on cracking his own DRMs. And so the mail
         loops on.

                             - Green/Palladium, like Green Kryptonite

         Could Lucky get himself arrested under the DMCA for
         distributing a circumvention device? Worse: now we have the
         EUCD incoming, could he here in the UK? Will Alan Cox go to
         jail for posting detailed Changelogs? Will even the nicest
         UK cryptographer (or curious garage tinkerer) find
         themselves hauled up under our new and scarily DMCAish
         copyright regime? Find out the facts at the free FAIR DEAL
         FOR COPYRIGHT conference, organised by the irrepressible
         FOUNDATION FOR INFORMATION POLICY RESEARCH for Wednesday
         2002-09-18 at the London School of Economics. All the usual
         fun from the creators of the Scrambling for Safety crypto
         cons: we confidently predict government spokesmen caught in
         headlights, wanton Dave Bird heckling, some industry bigwig
         fighting off the audience with a broken chairleg, and other
         epiphenomena of the interzone between legal minds and hacker
         ethics. Oh, and FIPR are still looking for a Programme
         Director, so if you're interested, let them know. We
         suggested a convention raffle (first prize: the director's
         job, second prize: Ross Anderson as your personal slave for
         a day). They say there's some rule that would break, though.
         http://www.fipr.org/vacancy.html
- doesn't the Foundation use psychohistory for filling these positions?

         For those of us who can't read the abbreviation EULA without 
         thinking of Martian fighting machines and their "deafening 
         howls... which roared like thunder", we're sorry to report 
         that this weekend's multimedia performance of Jeff Wayne's WAR 
         OF THE WORLDS has been postponed due to "health and safety 
         issues". The event was to feature computer graphics, 
         fireworks, "60ft-tall Martian fighting machines" wreaking 
         "havoc and destruction", and - most terrifyingly of all - the 
         possibility of a David Essex tribute singer performing with 
         Hawkwind, but UKP18 tickets for the Sat 2002-08-31 show at 
         Manchester's Heaton Park will still be valid at a range of new 
         venues next summer. Ironically, the Martians' original 
         invasion plans were similarly thwarted by health and safety 
         issues, "slain after all man's devices had failed by the 
         humblest creatures that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this 
         earth: bacteria. Minute, invisible, bacteria. For, directly 
         the invaders arrived and drank and fed, our microscopic allies 
         attacked them..."

         BRITISH BLOG COMPETITION (closing date next Fri 2002-09-06, 
         first prize UKP1000, entry free), in that any initiative that 
         encourages this notoriously primadonna-ish "community" to try 
         and engage with real-world notions of editorial quality surely 
         has to be a good thing. Our only disappointment is that The 
         Guardian appears to be focussing on the "best" of the entries, 
         when everyone knows the real fun is to be had cruising the 
         truly terrible examples that the genre has to offer, mentally 
         allocating points for "Most Depressing Recycling Of Daypop Top
         40 URLs", "Most Unsettling Revelations About Personal Life", 
         plus of course "Most Tedious Linking/Reciprocal Linking To Other

          The respective trademark holders will hate this, but
          Windows really *is* like the Sun. You have this big hulking
          mass of concentrated power in the middle, with a few small
          orbiting utilities - like WinZip, and PuTTY, and VNC.
          Occasionally one will get a bit too close to the OS, and
          Microsoft will suck it down and turn it into fuel for the
          System. One such discrete satellite remains FILEZILLA, the
          still-necessary ftp gui client for Windows. Those who know
          it won't need the introduction, although they might
          appreciate the note that it's getting close to v2.0 time.
          For dogged WS_FTP users, though, it's got multiple
          downloads, auto-restart of interrupted 'loads, queuing, and
          sftp and Kerberos support. It's also GPL'd which makes it a
          nice bit of source for anyone wanting to grok Win32
          networking from something that works.

         for those of us who can't read the abbreviation eula without 
         thinking of martian fighting machines and their "deafening 
         howls... which roared like thunder", we're sorry to report 
         that this weekend's multimedia performance of jeff wayne's war 
         of the worlds has been postponed due to "health and safety 
         issues". the event was to feature computer graphics, 
         fireworks, "60ft-tall martian fighting machines" wreaking 
         "havoc and destruction", and - most terrifyingly of all - the 
         possibility of a david essex tribute singer performing with 
         hawkwind, but ukp18 tickets for the sat 2002-08-31 show at 
         manchester's heaton park will still be valid at a range of new 
         venues next summer. ironically, the martians' original 
         invasion plans were similarly thwarted by health and safety 
         issues, "slain after all man's devices had failed by the 
         humblest creatures that god, in his wisdom, has put upon this 
         earth: bacteria. minute, invisible, bacteria. for, directly 
         the invaders arrived and drank and fed, our microscopic allies 
         attacked them..."

         controversially, we're all in favour of the guardian great 
         british blog competition (closing date next fri 2002-09-06, 
         first prize ukp1000, entry free), in that any initiative that 
         encourages this notoriously primadonna-ish "community" to try 
         and engage with real-world notions of editorial quality surely 
         has to be a good thing. our only disappointment is that the 
         guardian appears to be focussing on the "best" of the entries, 
         when everyone knows the real fun is to be had cruising the 
         truly terrible examples that the genre has to offer, mentally 
         allocating points for "most depressing recycling of daypop top
         40 urls", "most unsettling revelations about personal life", 
         plus of course "most tedious linking/reciprocal linking to other 
         bloggers in absence of having anything interesting to say".

          the respective trademark holders will hate this, but
          windows really *is* like the sun. you have this big hulking
          mass of concentrated power in the middle, with a few small
          orbiting utilities - like winzip, and putty, and vnc.
          occasionally one will get a bit too close to the os, and
          microsoft will suck it down and turn it into fuel for the
          system. one such discrete satellite remains filezilla, the
          still-necessary ftp gui client for windows. those who know
          it won't need the introduction, although they might
          appreciate the note that it's getting close to v2.0 time.
          for dogged ws_ftp users, though, it's got multiple
          downloads, auto-restart of interrupted 'loads, queuing, and
          sftp and kerberos support. it's also gpl'd which makes it a
          nice bit of source for anyone wanting to grok win32
          networking from something that works.
