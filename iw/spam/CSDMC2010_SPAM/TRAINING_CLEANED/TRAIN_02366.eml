Let me "copy/paste" from the official announcemnet¹:

***
"(...) For this reason, NVIDIA is dropping support, on new GPUs, for the
xf86-video-nv driver.

Details:

- NVIDIA will continue to support the existing functionality and
existing level of acceleration in the nv driver for existing GPUs,
on existing, and (within reason) future, X server versions.

- NVIDIA will not support the xf86-video-nv driver on Fermi or
later GPUs.

- NVIDIA will not support DisplayPort, on any GPU, in the
 xf86-video-nv driver."
***

So I think the "nv" driver will keep the same "bugs|features" that has 
right now and will still get some security patches, but I'm afraid that's 
all we (linux users) can expect.

- nvidia will not support the xf86-video-nv driver on fermi or

- nvidia will not support displayport, on any gpu, in the
 xf86-video-nv driver."
