NoneVLC will lag when reading local videos, whatever the codec-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi,

When watching videos locally, with VLC, it often lags at some parts of
the videos, and the following kinds of messages are displayed at the
console:

==
[some time] main video output error: picture [hexadecimal ref.] refcount is -1
overflow in spectral RLE, ignoring
==

The [some time] references are often ~40 times separated, i.e. I could
get

==
[00000010] main video output error: picture [hexadecimal ref.] refcount is -1
[00000050] main video output error: picture [hexadecimal ref.] refcount is -1
.
.
.
==

It does not only happen with Матрёшка files (.mkv). (I here
test if Gnus supports cyrillic out-of-the-box.)

Is it normal? Does it happen often with videos? What would it be due
to? Are they corrupted?

Thanks.

it does not only happen with  files (.mkv). (i here
test if gnus supports cyrillic out-of-the-box.)

is it normal? does it happen often with videos? what would it be due
to? are they corrupted?

thanks.
