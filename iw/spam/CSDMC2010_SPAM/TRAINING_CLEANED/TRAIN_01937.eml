they can also turn your monitor into a conversation piece.
Marine Aquarium, our Pick of the Week, will turn your desktop
into a virtual tropical fish aquarium that will make your Mac
turn some heads. No need to feed:

   Minimum requirements: Mac OS 8.6/9.x or Mac OS X

   The latest version of Apple's premiere media application

   CARTOON EDITOR
   Version: 1.2.1
   File size: 2.38MB
   License: Free
   Minimum requirements: Mac OS X

   Cartoon Editor won't turn you into a gifted cartoonist
   overnight. But what this graphic editor will do is make quick
   work of creating short QuickTime movies and animated GIFs--
   and for OS X freeware, it doesn't get much better than that.
   Cartoon Editor lets you draw or import JPEGs and GIFs, which
   you can then manipulate with a set of tools that lets you
   group, scale, duplicate, ghost, and all sorts of other useful
   cartoony things. The program's Java2D foundation allows for
   some surprisingly powerful features, like gradients,
   antialiasing, splining, and transparencies.

   License: Free
   Minimum Requirements: Mac OS X

   Get in touch with the natural rhythms of our solar system
   with MoonDock, a simple piece of software that tracks the
   phases of the moon for you and displays lovely images of our
   planet's companion satellite on your desktop. The images are
   high-quality color photos that change over time in accordance
   with the date. MoonDock includes both astronomical and survey
   data, meaning that you can calculate the appropriate moon
   phase for a particular date and identify topographical
   features on the moon using a built-in catalog of those that
   have been surveyed by astronomers and astronauts. This update
   incorporates improved help features and a few bug fixes.

   length. WebDesign offers a happy medium, with a significant
   number of nice extras. You can drag-and-drop from menus or
   edit your syntax line by line; build image maps and forms
   with relative ease; and work with a full selection of tools
   for site-wide color scheme changes, text manipulation, and
   localization. WebDesign supports both HTML and XHTML, along
