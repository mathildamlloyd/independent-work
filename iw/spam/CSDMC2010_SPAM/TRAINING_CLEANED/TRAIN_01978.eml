Nonewhere is what kontrol did?Hi,

I don't have KDE installed (fvwm instead) but use Konsole.

That has a warning funcion that shows up with a message 'KDE system 
notifications'.

It used to have a sound associated with it and I used to use kontrol to 
set that up. But kontrol is gone.

How do I get sound back for that notification?

I thought I had asked this question before but I can't find it.

Hugo
