If this is new behaviour in a previously working network, what did you do to it?

  Test the cables by switching which machine has which.
  Test the hub ports by switching cables around.
  Run ifconfig on the server - any errors and what kind they are.
  Test the network card... by replacing the thing!

Seriously, if the server has a PCI slot free, something like a Realtek 8139
based card costs less than 20 euro.  The design is a couple of generations later
- more memory, less cruft, no *FSCKING* dos config utility, no jumpers on the
card and it's PCI.
