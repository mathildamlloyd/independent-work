=2E..and I hate websites using a 200 kByte JavaScript,  sucking  500 MByte
of memory and  consuming  100%  CPU  resources  to  implement  the  same
functionality as the Adobe Flash-Pluging.

Yes, I know a bunch of Websites claiming there are  Flash-Free...  Using
JavaScript for this purpose is the same crap as using Flash.

Thanks, Greetings and nice Day/Evening
