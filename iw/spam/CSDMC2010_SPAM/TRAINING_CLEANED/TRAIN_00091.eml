Nonelatest php upgrade in 7.3Today an apt-get upgrade holds back php (and submodules, like php-imap). 
  Running an apt-get install php to see what's up, I get:

# apt-get install php
Processing File Dependencies... Done
Reading Package Lists... Done
Building Dependency Tree... Done
The following extra packages will be installed:
   curl-devel imap imap-devel mysql mysql-devel php-imap php-ldap postgresql
   postgresql-devel postgresql-libs pspell-devel ucd-snmp-devel 
ucd-snmp-utils
   unixODBC unixODBC-devel
The following NEW packages will be installed:
   curl-devel imap imap-devel mysql mysql-devel postgresql postgresql-devel
   postgresql-libs pspell-devel ucd-snmp-devel ucd-snmp-utils unixODBC
   unixODBC-devel
The following packages will be upgraded
   php php-imap php-ldap
3 packages upgraded, 13 newly installed, 0 to remove(replace) and 1 not 
upgraded.

Anyone have an idea what the heck RedHat did here, and why we're now 
trying to install a ton of crap I don't want?  (I'm hoping someone else 
has chased this down and could save me time... ;) )

thx,
-te
