Package              : python-clamav
Version              : 0.4.1-1.1~volatile1 (Lenny)
Importance           : medium

python-clamav, which provides Python bindings to ClamAV, a virus scanning
engine, needed a recompilation with the newer clamav 0.95.3.  If you use
python-clamav directly or through nautilus-clamscan, we strongly recommend
you to upgrade to this version, as the old version the package was linked
against stopped working.


Upgrade Instructions
--------------------

You can get the updated packages at

http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile/pool/volatile/main/p/python-clamav

and install them with dpkg, or add the volatile archive for Lenny
to your /etc/apt/sources.list:

 deb http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile lenny/volatile main
 deb-src http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile lenny/volatile main

You can also use any of our mirrors.  See
http://www.debian.org/volatile/volatile-mirrors for the full list of
mirrors.  The archive signing keys were included in Debian Lenny.
