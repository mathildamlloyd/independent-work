NoneWell Beberg, unless you're really into Anime and actually hold true
that dead people can send email, I think Geege's subject is just dandy.
Especially since she removed herself from the hive that is aol (and
placed herself unto another, but hey :-))

Geege:  I think its cute when he worries like that, don't you?
:)

*ducks and runs*

(bonus FoRK points if Adam knows what anime i'm refering to)
