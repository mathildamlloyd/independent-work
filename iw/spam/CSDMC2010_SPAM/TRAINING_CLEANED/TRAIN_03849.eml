NoneBadAtom X11 Error with fpGUIHi,

When running pascal programs based on fpGUI, an X11 based interface =
package, I get an error if the application needs to create the top level =
(root?) X11 window. but only then. If there is already a toplevel =
window, for example because xterm runs, then the application open its =
window and everything behaves as expected.

the problematic call is this:

XGetWMProtocols(FDisplay, AWindow, @Protocols, @Count);

gdb shows these values (if there is an X11 window, the values are =
exactly the same):

4: COUNT =3D 0
3: PROTOCOLS =3D 0x0
2: AWINDOW =3D 6291457
1: this->FDISPLAY =3D 0x803a00

This call produces this X11 error:

X Error of failed request:  BadAtom (invalid Atom parameter)
 Major opcode of failed request:  18 (X_ChangeProperty)
 Atom id in failed request:  0x0
 Serial number of failed request:  103
 Current serial number in output stream:  104

System: Mac OS X 10.6.3

X11 version:
michael% X -version
X.org Release 7.3
X.Org X Server 1.4.2-apple53
Build Date: 20100211

Someone suggested  XSync and XInterAtom , but I am fairly clueless, when =
it comes to X11. So could you give me directions how to resolve this?
