Wow...

How about...?

1/ Pressing "O.K", instead "save", it will keep your settings only for the
current session but it just to test if it works :-?

2/ Look at "~/.hptalx" file and check if the previously saved settings 
seem right (port connection pointing to /dev/ttyUSB0, and so on...).
