You know, latest iceweasel, openoffice, gnome, etc. Maybe using unstable or experimental repo? I'm sure there's many ways to do this, but I just don't know.. I'm new to debian :(

Run sidux.  It is Debian unstable with some people doing some extra work 
to keep it a bit more stable for you.  Use the smxi script which helps 
keep things stable also (and simplifies installation of some software to 
boot).  I love sidux on the desktop (and vanilla Debian on my servers).
