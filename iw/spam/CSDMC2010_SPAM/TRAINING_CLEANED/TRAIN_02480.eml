Hi,
I have Sun VirtualBox. It's easy to use and install.
The guests OS that I tried and work: Debian, MEPIS, OpenSolaris, 
OpenSuse, Solaris 10, XP and some other Linux distros. DesktopBSD and 
FreeBSD work but can't get GUI -that can be lack of my knowledge.

Same with open VirtualBox except I think that there is no USB support.

Aqemu (qemu) easy to use and install -DesktopBSD work's with GUI.

I think that all VM have file sharing, printing depends on USB if you 
have USB printer.

hi,
i have sun virtualbox. it's easy to use and install.
the guests os that i tried and work: debian, mepis, opensolaris, 
opensuse, solaris 10, xp and some other linux distros. desktopbsd and 
freebsd work but can't get gui -that can be lack of my knowledge.

same with open virtualbox except i think that there is no usb support.

aqemu (qemu) easy to use and install -desktopbsd work's with gui.

i think that all vm have file sharing, printing depends on usb if you 
have usb printer.
