Actually, I personally have not. However, this was actually the design
goal of Qt4 and many users have tested and reported lower memory usage
in KDE 4 compared to KDE 3. I don't know about CPU, though.

Also, the last time I ran KDE 3.5.10 it felt was noticeably lagging
compared to my then-current KDE 4.3 setup on the same hardware. Note
that the KDE 4.3 even had quite a few other apps installed, and the
KDE 3.5.10 was a new install that I did to triage a possible
regression.

Like I said, though, if you need Qt3 libraries in addition to Qt4 (for
Quanta, for instance) then you will be using the memory of _both_,
naturally, and that is a lot!
