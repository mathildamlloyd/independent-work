I don't know about this particular card, but I got a Dell 1505 (BCM
4323) to work with the Linux driver available from Broadcom (Google
Broadcom STA linux).  This is not an open-source driver.  Some part of
it is, another part is a binary blob, but it worked beautifully for me.

Cheers,
Norbert
