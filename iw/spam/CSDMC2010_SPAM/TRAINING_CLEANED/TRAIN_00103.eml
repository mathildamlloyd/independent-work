None[ILUG] gargnome & sawfish.. I decided to try out GarGnome, to see what gnome2 looks like. It's
pretty, I'll give it that.

 However, there seemed to be loads of bugs - sawfish threw wobblers all
over the place, so I tryed out metacity - which doesn't have a GUI
configurator, and arsed if I'm going back to the fvwm days when you had to
set settings by hand, without an idea what the values looked like.

 So, I went back to 1.4 - and now sawfish can't start applets (yes, I did
change the LD_LIBRARY_PATH back) and the panel can't make new workspaces.

 Any ideas what could have happened ? Would sawfish 2.0 silently change
the config files & break them?
