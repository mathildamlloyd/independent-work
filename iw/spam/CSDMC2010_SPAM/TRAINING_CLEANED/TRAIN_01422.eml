Noneinsurance company didn't pay a claim quickly enough.  It might have been
$.02.

Although they spent lots more than $.33 to mail you the check, the
alternative seems to be to keep the money.  Do you really want companies
to have a financial incentive to over-bill you 'just a bit' so they
could keep it?  For a company with millions of customers, $.33/customer
starts adding up.

re: the absurdities of life.they are legally required to do that.  i got a similar check because an
insurance company didn't pay a claim quickly enough.  it might have been
$.02.

although they spent lots more than $.33 to mail you the check, the
alternative seems to be to keep the money.  do you really want companies
to have a financial incentive to over-bill you 'just a bit' so they
