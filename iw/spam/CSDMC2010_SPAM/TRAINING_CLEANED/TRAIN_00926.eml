I used to install Japanese fonts via aptitude.  But I rather think that they 
were installed by default on my most recent installation, so I can't speak 
for now.  Try "aptitude search <language>" and see what happens?  Or do a 
google/linux search?

Which East Asian fonts are you wanting, if the language is not in the list?
