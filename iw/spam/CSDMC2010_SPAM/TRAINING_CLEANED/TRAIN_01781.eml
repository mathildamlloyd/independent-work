I never used ConfigParser before, but I read that its read() method silently
ignores files that don't exist.  If 'bayes.ini' isn't found, *none* of the
options will be defined.  Since you want to run this from a directory other
than my spambayes directory, it's up to you to check in changes to make that
possible <wink>.
