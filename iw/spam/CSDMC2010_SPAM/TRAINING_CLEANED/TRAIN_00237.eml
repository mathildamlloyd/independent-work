None[Razor-users] Problem with SDK 2.03?
I recently brought up a new system - SuSe 7.3 and I am running
spamassassin and procmail, which work fine.

I tried bringing up razor (2.14) but I am not able to get the SDK to
install and razor reports missing modules. They appear to be there. I
followed the installation directions. There appears to be an endless list
of errors. Any ideas on what to do or where to start?

Doug
