I am sorry if I upset people. I was faced with a situation that I did
not understand and thought that I would query those with far more
experience after searching the web yielded nothing useful. Would you

knowing a thing about what I'm getting into, especially when the goal
"read from / write to the card reader" is so straightforward?.
