in a dining area with WiFi/Airport available.  We are very fortunate to =
be near Dave Marra, Apple Senior Systems Engineer, who is a speaker at =
many MUGs including ours.

Apple Store that has been absolutely zero help except some of our =
members always have the latest gizmos, like iPads, the day they are =
introduced.  We also have several Apple vendors and an Apple third party =
manufacturer in the area.  They are much more of a help.

software.  We don't do many programs on Adobe products but do some on =
Microsoft products.  Some members are into other Unix systems such as =
Linux and open-source software.
