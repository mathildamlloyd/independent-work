It appears that ld-lsb symlinks are created by lsb-core postinst
script. That's why they're not listed in package contents.

Kent, it seems that it's a somehow better solution for you to install
the lsb-core package (or a whole lsb group) rather than create that
symlink manually (it's not that important though).
