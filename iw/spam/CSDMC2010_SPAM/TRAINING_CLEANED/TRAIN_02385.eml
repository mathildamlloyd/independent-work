Noneactually did make thing more readable and he is highly skilled at 
regular expressions.  I have found that readability and 
understandability is important in maintaining code. I think in a group 
project that it's more important.

re: [sadev] [bug 584] new: more general rule cleanupthanks dan. and the changes were very clever. some of his rule changes 
actually did make thing more readable and he is highly skilled at 
regular expressions.  i have found that readability and 
understandability is important in maintaining code. i think in a group 
project that it's more important.
