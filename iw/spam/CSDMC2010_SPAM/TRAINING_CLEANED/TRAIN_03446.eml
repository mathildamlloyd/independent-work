I may have a different version of "sh" than you do; the double quotes
around the backticks work for my "sh".

(In the more-than-you-really-wanted-to-know category, you're probably
safe without the double quotes.  The only reason I put them in is that
I have some pathologically-named folders, including folders whose
names contain spaces.  If all your folders have safe names, you don't
need special quoting.)
