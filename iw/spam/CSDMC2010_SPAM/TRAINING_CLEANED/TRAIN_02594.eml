If you dislike Red Hat, why use it ? This was a really bad argument 
against using Red Hat that makes no sense at all.  I for one am GLAD that 
they 
a) don't overwrite your config files on a whim (be GLAD they don't do some 
sort of autodetection and changing crap)
b) tell you on rpm upgrade what config files you should look at because 
formats have changed.

Red Hat is not "taking it easy" on this, it's putting control in the hands 
of you, the maintainer of the machine.  Don't be lazy.

You don't need to backup /home if you are careful enough.  You did put 
/home on a separate partition, no ? Just install rh80 and tell it to use 
the same partition as /home and tell it to NOT format it, but keep the 
data as is.

If you didn't put /home on a separate partition, then you really do need 
to make backups.  Use an nfs or smb mount from another machine to backup 
and rsync straight to the mount, or if that's not possible, rsync over 
ssh.  It's the best way to make backups.

It's the other way around - your media files are backups of the CD's they 
came from ;)

Good luck,
Thomas
