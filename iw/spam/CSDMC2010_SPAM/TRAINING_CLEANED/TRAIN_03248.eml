I don't know of any backported binaries, so you would have to compile it
yourself. That, however, would be a major undertaking, and presupposes
that the latest KDE4 even compiles against the versions of the various
libraries included in lenny.

An alternative is to upgrade to testing/unstable, but then you would no
longer have the uncomplicated life of a lenny user :-)

Or you could wait for the next stable release, or at least for the
freeze announcement.
