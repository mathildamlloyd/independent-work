None[ILUG] NFS slowness with SuSE 8.1NFS as a protocol is not known for its speediness but this is absurd. I did an 
NFS install of a box this morning (that would be the box which won't boot 
from CD for those who were in IRC) and it was rather slow but I just left it 
to it. Having got it up, I want to copy the DVD to a disk on it so I have it 
handy for installing any further bits I might require. So I simply mounted 
the NFS exported DVD on the new box and started copying. 

After a couple of minutes I looked - it was transferring about 8MB a MINUTE. 
So I killed that and used rsync instead which is ticking away now at about 
100 MB/min - still not exactly turbo charged but a lot better than the NFS 
rate. Any ideas as to what's making it SO slow ? There's really no point in 
running more nfsd processes, as there is exactly one client, so I'm a little 
at a loss I must say.
