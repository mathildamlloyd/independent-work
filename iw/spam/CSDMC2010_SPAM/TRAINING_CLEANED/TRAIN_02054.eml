NoneA couple of nits...
I have a couple of small issues, and I'm not sure if their exmh issues
or my setup issues.

First, when I try and run exmh with wish from tk8.4.0 it seems to take
forever to start, but with wish from tk8.a.4 it starts in a snap.

Using the latest CVS, when I open exmh and the folder I'm in has unseen
messages and I hit next, exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages
rather than to the first unseen in the current folder.

Finally, when I reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on to
the next unseen, exmh always goes back to inbox (which has no unseen
messages) rather than the next folder with unseen messages.  (When I 
goto next from inbox it does go where I would think it should go).

Just wanted to let you know what I'm seeing and find out if I'm expecting
some different than I should be.

Thanks for all the effort

Jim
