You can just recompile the apt source RPM, if it's the newer one. (Such
as mine). There's no dependancies on libstdc++ other than binary ones.

Currently on release dwd2, which I'm using on my home rawhide box.
(Obviously not production, since the old apt works fine on production
boxes).

Now... Does anyone know of a good way to delete "old" RPMS from a
directory containing both "new" and "old" RPMS? Say I have
blurb-0.1.0-1.i386.rpm, blurb-0.1.0-2.i386.rpm, and
blurb-0.1.1-1.i386.rpm, and want to remove the blurb-0.1.0-* because of
the presence of blurb-0.1.1-1? Anyone have a convenient script?

Dave.
