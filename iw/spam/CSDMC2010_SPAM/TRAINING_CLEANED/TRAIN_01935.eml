When Lenny was released, KDE4 was just plain broken. Since then, it 
has matured such that other distributions which have released with 
it.

I do not believe the decision to stay with KDE3 in Lenny was anything 
other than the simple pragmatic fact that Lenny was being released at 
that time.

As much as I prefer KDE3, I agree that there is nothing else the 
Debian developers can do, since to take up KDE3 would require 
effectively duplicating the entire KDE development team.

The dropping of KDE3 is a simple fact of life because it is no longer 
maintained upstream. I hope the pain will be worth it in the long 
run.

What I do not appreciate is that the attitude has been not "we have to 
do this", but "we're doing it, must suck to be you."

as much as i prefer kde3, i agree that there is nothing else the 
debian developers can do, since to take up kde3 would require 
effectively duplicating the entire kde development team.

the dropping of kde3 is a simple fact of life because it is no longer 
maintained upstream. i hope the pain will be worth it in the long 
run.

what i do not appreciate is that the attitude has been not "we have to
