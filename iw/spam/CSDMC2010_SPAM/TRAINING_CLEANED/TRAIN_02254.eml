I checked. Union is described in the Ritchie, Johnson, Lesk, and
Kernighan, The C Programming Language, in Bell System Technical
Journal of JULY-AUGUST 1978, p. 1991. At that time the Bell System had
C compilers running on PDP-11, Honeywell 6000, IBM System/370, and
Interdata 8/32.  You're right. >20years.

i checked. union is described in the ritchie, johnson, lesk, and
kernighan, the c programming language, in bell system technical
journal of july-august 1978, p. 1991. at that time the bell system had
c compilers running on pdp-11, honeywell 6000, ibm system/370, and
interdata 8/32.  you're right. >20years.
