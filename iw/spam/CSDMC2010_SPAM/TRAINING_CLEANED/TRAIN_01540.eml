NoneAlternative to dhcp?I edited /etc/resolv.conf to add a nameserver, edited /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf 
to do the same and added the dns to wicd.  However, I keep getting the same 
old dns from the router, i.e., resolv.conf keeps changing to the router's 192 
ip.  The router does not allow editing dns.  I think this is due to using 
dhcp.  Is there an alternative which wouldn't cause a default to the router's 
dns?  Any pointers appreciated.
