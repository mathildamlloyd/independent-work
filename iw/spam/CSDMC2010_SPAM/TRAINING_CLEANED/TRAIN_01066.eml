None[Razor-users] Razor2 error: can't find "new"
Using Razor2 via SpamAssasin.

System is Solaris 2.7, with qmail. Spamassassin run via user's procmail.
All users who use SA have run razor-register.

Razor2 is failing, and I can't find anything in the limited docs or on 
google on it,
and I'm hoping someone can help.

The error (which doesn't prevent SA from working) is:

Oct  2 06:38:22 sancho2 qmail: 1033565902.186041 delivery 4588: success: 
razor2_check_skipped:_Bad_file_number_Can't_locate_object_m
ethod_"new"_via_package_"Razor2::Client::Agent"_(perhaps_you_forgot_to_load_"Razor2::Client::Agent"?)_at_/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_p
erl/5.6.1/Mail/SpamAssassin/Dns.pm_line_374./did_0+0+1/

Looking at Dns.pm doesn't really help me, and Razor2::Client::Agent appears 
to be in the right place,
in /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.1/Razor2/Client.

Ideas?

...Chris
