It doesn't work in krunner when it is. See here:

decimal in keyword delimiter which krunner doesnt support

I did so really. This bug report contains quite some hints on testing with=
=20
an empty configuration. Its as easy as that:

mkdir ~/.kde-test
export KDEHOME=3D~/.kde-test

Then start your KDE application you want to test with empty settings from=20
this shell. You can also easily see what configuration files the applicatio=
n=20
or the subsystems it uses create.
