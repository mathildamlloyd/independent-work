NoneHow does the Finder decide that two drives are on the same
	partition?When I make two "local" disks via MacFuse and I try to eject one of them =
the Finder insists on warning me that there are two drives on the same =
partition, and giving me the option to unmount all of them or just the =
one I tried to. This is very inconvenient for me.

The mount command shows:


MyFS@fuse0 on /Volumes/MyFS_2Gig (...)
MyFS@fuse1 on /Volumes/MyFS_4Gig (...)

My suspicion is that the Finder just looks for the mount=46rom value =
then calls volumes partitions on the same disk if they only vary in the =
last number.

Thoughts?

Thanks,
Jim O'Connor=
