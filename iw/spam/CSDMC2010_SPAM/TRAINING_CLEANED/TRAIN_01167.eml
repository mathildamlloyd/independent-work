I'm sure that if you file a bugzilla entry with a relevant patch against
the spec file, chances of getting the change done are on your side ;-)

The problem is that "--with <foo> --without <bar>" is clearly not meant to
change deeply the way a package is built. Its use would be more like
enabling/disabling gpg, ldap, whateversql support in packages as it's not
possible to use something like "--with-<foo>=<bar>" which could be used for
a much wider scope.

the problem is that "--with  --without " is clearly not meant to
change deeply the way a package is built. its use would be more like
enabling/disabling gpg, ldap, whateversql support in packages as it's not
possible to use something like "--with-=" which could be used for
a much wider scope.
