You got the output of 'show databases'. You then consider it a shell
command and try to excute it. Why would you want to do that? What do you
want to do with that output?

BTW: I would suggest that you actually use a .my.cnf to hold the
password, otherwise the password is available in e.g. the output of 'ps
auxww'
