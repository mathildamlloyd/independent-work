Not unless you want to upgrade your entire system to Sid.  To install
only certain cherry-picked applications from Sid, you have to use
apt pinning.  And don't use synaptic.  (But since you don't have X
running, you can't use synaptic.  Yet.  But once you get it running,
don't use synaptic.  I've heard that it does not respect apt pinning.)
