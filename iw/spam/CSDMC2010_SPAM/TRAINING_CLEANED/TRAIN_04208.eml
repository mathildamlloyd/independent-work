You mean packets coming in from the Internet with a destination IP that is 
assigned to the router itself?  Are you running any sort of routing protocol 
or similar that communicates with your ISP's routers, including things like 
MPLS, or any VPNs/tunnels that terminate at the border router? What about NAT 
or port forwarding on the border router?
