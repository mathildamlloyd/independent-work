I don't understand this explanation.  I generate large image files all
the time using java.awt.headless=true.  My graphics code can't tell the
difference whether it's running on real AWT or headless AWT, it works
fine either way.  I didn't have to do anything special for this to work.
Are you sure it matters to your code?

Just checking...
