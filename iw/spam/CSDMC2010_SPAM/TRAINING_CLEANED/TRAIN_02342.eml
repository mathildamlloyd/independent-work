Thank you Hugo, I managed to compile the proprietary driver.
Now every ctrl+alt+Fn leads to a complete black screen, with no prompt 
or cursor or anything.
Ctrl+alt+F7 works as expected.
Could it be that my system stopped creating the consoles at boot time ?
What should I check and where ?

TIA,
Jean-Marc
