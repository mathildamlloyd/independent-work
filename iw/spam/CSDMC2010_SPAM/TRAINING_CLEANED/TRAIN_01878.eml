You are better off using the upstream tarball of thunderbird then trying 
to backport Icedove from squeeze/lenny. Install to your homedir or /opt. 
As long as your user has write perms to file, it has an update manager 
that can upgrade itself (somewhat eliminating the need for package 
management).
