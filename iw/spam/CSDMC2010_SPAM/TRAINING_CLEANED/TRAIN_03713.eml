Did you actually attempt to order the DSL? Large chunks of somerville have
advertised DSL service that can't actually be obtained. Excuses vary, from
"no available copper" to "full DSLAM", but the folks I know who've wanted
DSL around here have all failed, ending up either with ATTBB, RCN or an
honest-to-god T1.

This is scary.  I'm imagining tracerouting you and seeing links like "Route
84" and "Route 9, Exit 14".  Obviously, this is illness induced.
