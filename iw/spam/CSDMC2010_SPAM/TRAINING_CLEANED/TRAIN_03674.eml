NoneI sent the email below earlier today to this list, but apparently it
didn't go through. Maybe attachments are not allowed? If that's the
case, I apologize.

Anyway, the original email is below, and the figure showing the visual
glitches I mention can be retrieved at
www.cefala.org/~vilela/visual_glitches.png

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

Adriano
