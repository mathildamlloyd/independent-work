openprinting.org has a by-manufacturer listing grouping all the 
"Perfectly" working printers together, then the "Mostly" then the 
"Partially" and "Paperweight".

For example:
http://www.openprinting.org/printers/manufacturer/Epson/
http://www.openprinting.org/printers/manufacturer/Fujitsu/
http://www.openprinting.org/printers/manufacturer/HP
http://www.openprinting.org/printers/manufacturer/Dell

Even though it's marked as "Mostly", I really like my Dell 3100cn 
color laser printer.  It's *big*, and was $350 about 5 years ago but 
being laser printer is toner-based, and powder doesn't dry out.
