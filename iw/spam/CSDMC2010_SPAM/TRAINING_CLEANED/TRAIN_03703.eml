Before pressing "Connect" be sure your calculator is setup as described 
here:

http://hptalx.sourceforge.net/manual.shtml#AEN171

Can you see the "Awaiting Server Cmd." message in calculator's display?

Port "100"? What kind of port nomenclature is that? :-? 

I would expect "/dev/ttyUSB0" for an USB device or "/dev/ttyS0" for the 
first rs-232 port...

I think the application is crashing because cannot establish a connection 
with the device.

before pressing "connect" be sure your calculator is setup as described 
here:

http://hptalx.sourceforge.net/manual.shtml#aen171

can you see the "awaiting server cmd." message in calculator's display?

i would expect "/dev/ttyusb0" for an usb device or "/dev/ttys0" for the 
first rs-232 port...

i think the application is crashing because cannot establish a connection 
with the device.
