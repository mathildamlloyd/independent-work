A better DebConf10 with your help: donate or become a sponsor


DebConf is the Debian Project's developer conference. In addition to a
full schedule of technical, social and policy talks, DebConf provides
an opportunity for developers, contributors and other interested people
to meet in person and work together. It has taken place annually since
2000 in locations as varied as Canada, Finland, Mexico, Scotland, and
Argentina. This year DebConf10 is in New York City, New York, USA.

This year, as every year, a great deal of the burden for the conference
is placed on Debian volunteers who donate time and energy to organizing
the conference. Your help would be most welcome. If you are interested
in volunteering, you can contact debconf-team [at] lists.debian.org.

Alternatively, you can help DebConf10 by donating money which will be
used to enable those Debian contributors who currently cannot attend
due to funding shortage. You can contribute money by either becoming a
sponsor (if you are a company) or donating money as an individual.

As Raphael Geissert wrote on his blog: "DebConf10 needs your help!
That's right: it needs help from potential sponsors and donors to help
cover the costs implied by this event. If you are interested in
becoming a sponsor please contact sponsors [at] debconf.org, or if you
want to make a donation please visit the DebConf10 >donations page [1].

Companies or organizations can, in addition to money donation, lend
equipment for the conference.

Current sponsors of DebConf10 include HP [2], Google [3], Canonical
[4], Intel [5], Collabora [6], Bytemark [7] and Univention [8], plus
our permanent and media sponsors [9]; we thank them for their support
already!

About Debian
------------

The Debian Project was founded in 1993 by Ian Murdock to be a truly
free, community project. Since then the project has grown to be one of
the largest and most influential open source projects.  Over three
thousand volunteers from all over the world work together to create and
maintain Debian software. Translated into over 30 languages, and
supporting a huge range of computer types, Debian calls itself the
"universal operating system".
