I've seen this recently in #debian and we were able to "fix" this with
the following in /etc/X11/xorg.conf

Section "Device"
        Identifier "r128"
        Driver "r128"
        Option "NoAccel"
EndSection

the related bug report is [1] and this will disable acceleration for
your card, so it is not really a good fix. You might also want to make
sure that you have the firmware package(s) installed.

Good luck
