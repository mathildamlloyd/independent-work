Nonecompile multiple java toolsI'm not sure this is the right list to write to... sorry in any case...

I have three different tools (e.g. A, B, C) that use the same package (a 
package I created).
Is there a way to put it all in a singe XCode project that creates the 
package, then A.jar, B.jar and finally C.jar?
I tried with multiple targets, but it didn't work (may be I forgot to 
set some options?).

Any idea?

Many thanks in advance,
best regards,
livio.
