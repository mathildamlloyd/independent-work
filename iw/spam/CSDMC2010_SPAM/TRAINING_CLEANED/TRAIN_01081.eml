NoneA Non-Integer Power Function on the Pixel ShaderURL: http://www.newsisfree.com/click/-0,8613675,159/
Date: 2002-10-06T18:12:45+01:00

This feature, excerpted from Wolfgang Engel's ShaderX book from Wordware 
Publishing, presents a simple shader trick that performs a good per pixel 
approximation of a non-integer power function. The technique works for input 
values between 0 and 1 and supports large exponents. The presented shader does 
not require any texture look-up and is scalable, making it possible to spend 
more instructions in order to decrease the error or to reach greater exponents.
