No sweat.  We're all on the same team.  I wish Alejandro would send an
update.  I'm kinda curious as to what was/is actually causing the problem.

Come to think of it, has he even replied to any of our posts?  It doesn't
look like he has.  Seems that communication with the Cubans on debian-users
is just plain spotty, whatever the reason.

If we don't hear back, I hope he got it working.
