it is nowadays to write something that's not

Users of messenger client Trillian are vulnerable to attack, according to
information security analyst John Hennessy.

Hennessy has published a proof-of-concept showing the latest version of
Trillian, v0.73, is vulnerable to a buffer-overflow attack that will
allow individuals with malicious intent to run any program on the
computer.

Trillion is a piece of software that allows you to connect to ICQ, AOL
Instant Messenger, MSN Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger and IRC with a single
interface, despite some companies actively avoiding messenger
interoperability.

According to Jason Ross, senior analyst at amr interactive, in June 2002
there were 28,000 home users of Trillian in Australia, about 0.4 percent
of the Internet population, and 55,000 people using it at work, about 1.8
percent of the Internet population.

David Banes, regional manager of Symantec security response, told ZDNet
Australia the code appeared to be valid.

"With these sort of things you have to find some process that would
accept a connection, then throw loads of random data at it and get it to
crash," he said. "Once it's crashed, you can try to find a way to exploit
it."

He said the proof-of-concept that was published is designed to run on
Notepad, but could be easily modified to run any program on the system.
He said the problem was easy to fix by "writing protective code around
that particular piece to more closely validate the data around that
piece."

"Because people are pushed for productivity you tend to leave out the
checks and balances you should put in, which is why we have all these
buffer overflows and exploits out there now," said Banes.

Cerulean Studios, creator of Trillian, was contacted for comment but had
not responded by the time of publication.
