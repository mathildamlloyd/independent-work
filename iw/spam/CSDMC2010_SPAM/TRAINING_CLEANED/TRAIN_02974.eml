Aside from the quality issue, two+ years ago there was considerable
internet chatter about BIOSes on some Foxconn models that were
unfriendly to Linux.  According to the Foxconn article in the Wikipedia
Foxconn was forced by some of the companies which used Foxconn boards in
their own brands to fix those BIOSes.  In any event if the information
in that article is even half true, Foxconn is a manufacturer to avoid.

As I mentioned in my "another thought" post, I am planning to use a
Nvidia GPU anyway, mainly in order to have two monitors.

Good to know.

In view of your comments I looked further into what is available
locally.  The model I was originally looking at was a GA-G31M-ES2L for
CA$59.00.  I found however a GA-EP43-UD3L with the ICH10 and many other
more advanced features including better Realtek audio for CA$83.00.  As
I am using an external GPU which GPU internal chipset is provided is not
really an issue for me. I think the latter model is better value for the
price.
