When I try for this procedure , I just see loging in and loging out from the
telnet session . Actually , I need to have the output result of issuing
'command1' on the remote node to be captured on my local host . But when I
try manually , say telnet to it and issue the command , I see the output on
my screen . Please help me how to modify my simple code to have the desired
result?
Thank you
