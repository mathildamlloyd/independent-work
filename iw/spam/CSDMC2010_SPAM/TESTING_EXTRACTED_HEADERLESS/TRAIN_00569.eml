&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; mount /cdrom usually works - what does your fstab say for /dev/sr=
0 ?<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
&gt; &gt;<br>
</div></div>If you look at the /etc/fstab -<br>
<br>
You have something that will read CD (iso9660) and DVD (udf) format for<br>
a device mounted at /media/cdrom0 in this case.<br>
<br>
Gnome automount daemon or equivalent would find it there and offer to<br>
open it for you.<br>
<br>
In root ( /)<br>
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br>
<br>
In /, you may have a symlink which points cdrom -&gt; /media/cdrom<br>
<br>
Further down in the filesystem, under /dev, udev or its equivalent<br>
normally points an alias to the same physical device during the<br>
installation process.<br>
<br>
In /dev<br>
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br>
In my case /dev/hda is the physical device, so in /dev, cdrom is linked<br>
to hda as is cdrw - all pointing back ot /dev/hda<br>
<br>
ls -al cdrom gives<br>
<br>
cdrom -&gt; hda<br>
<br>
Same for DVD. [dvd, dvdrw]<br>
<br>
If you want to mount something temporarily e.g. to copy something off an<br=
>
.iso image (it&#39;s also worth looking at and learning how to loop mount a=
n<br>
.iso image), something like the following as root where /tmp/tempcd is a<br=
>
temporary mountpoint you&#39;ll remove later.<br>
<br>
mkdir /tmp/tempcd<br>
<br>
mount -t iso9660 /dev/hda /tmp/tempcd<br>
<br>
cp /tmp/tempcd/* /home/&lt;username/<br>
<br>
so the second line is the equivalent of the mount command you normally<br>
