I don't find that to be true at all.  For non-removable media except / you =

simply use UUIDs everything should be fine.  For / you can generally use a=

using udev to fill in any gaps; writing udev rules doesn't really require=20
familiarity with hardware (udev will tell you everything useful) and there =

some descent guides available.
