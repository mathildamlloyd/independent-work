i have a working apt 0.5.4cnc7 package for red hat linux 8.0. it will be
available at the same second the distribution will, and so will a complete
apt repository already including quite a few of my packages updated for red
hat linux 8.0.

i didn't want to say all this before monday, but as the new release already
leaked from many places, and official statements made about it, it
shouldn't be a big deal :-/

i'll keep you all posted on monday! they'll even be a big apt-related
surprise! ;-))))
