i have to force quit out of netbeans once or twice a day, running
on snow leopard.  when i look at the log i see a cryptic error message
like this one:
4/19/10 4:04:24 pmcom.apple.launchd.peruser.501[98] 
([0x0-0x14014].org.netbeans.ide.baseide.200912041610[182]) exited with  
exit code: 143

anyone have advice on preventing these problems?  googling for 143
suggests it applies to a lot of different things, but might just be  
the jvm
telling me it has been killed.
