using -lm 4 is yielding an extra 20% a day, but it gets false positives
where it shouldn't.

such as an email with a word doc and the signature below.  after looking at
the word doc, directions to the sender's cabin, i am convinced it marked the
body, which contains no next except the "incredimail advertisment"
signature, as spam.

so i have to turn off -lm 4.  razor has been getting other strange emails it
shouldn't with -lm 4 on.

      see the incredimail ad signature i am talking about below:

      fox
