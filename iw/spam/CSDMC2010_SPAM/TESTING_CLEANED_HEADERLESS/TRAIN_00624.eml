can you clarify?  listing all the functions in the current shell environment
solves my issue perfectly.. but less is just a pager, no?  oh, wait, did you
mean "much less list"?   in which case, we're in the same boat, but i'm
hoping there is a solution i'm not aware of (even though my hopes are dim :)

that would work pretty much everywhere except bone-stock solaris, where i
have no possibility of recovery -- "/bin/bash: bad interpreter: no such file
or directory".  at least if i use /bin/sh as my interpreter, i can always at
the very least output an error message.

i suppose my other alternative is roughly  [ -x /bin/bash ] && /bin/bash $0
$* && exit $?, and assume that everywhere-but-solaris has /bin/bash. hmm.
if debian keeps bash around as a default package, even when dash-is-bin-sh,
then i guess i'm in fairly safe territory in that regard.

thanks,
wes
