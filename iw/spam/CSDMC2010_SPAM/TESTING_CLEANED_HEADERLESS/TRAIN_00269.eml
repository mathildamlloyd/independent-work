oh, neat.

i have similiar thing in my hands, though it might be migratable if i
had the time to try. i've been using another 6.x repository though.
http://apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org/apt

anyone tried (dist-)upgrade from 6.x to 7? theoretically it should drop
in some -compat's (notably libc) and upgrade the rest and after a reboot
and maybe a new kernel (and grub, but i have long before put those to
v6's :) run just fine. haven't had a spare machine to try it on myself,
though.
