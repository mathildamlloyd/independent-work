=09=09=09dear readers,
=09=09=09
on the surface, it seems odd that microsoft and aol compete with
one another. after all, while microsoft is a giant software
powerhouse, aol time warner is totally different--a giant media
powerhouse. nonetheless, they're at it again, working like crazy
to dominate the isp space. while aol is busy renovating the guts
of upcoming aol 8.0, which will finally integrate the netscape
browser, microsoft is nipping at its competition's heels with msn
8.0. will microsoft make enough improvements to finally catch up
with aol? it just might. find out more in our msn 8.0 first
take.

ever heard of a type of lawsuit known as a cyberslapp? we hadn't eit=
her. a cyberslapp case
typically involves "a person who has posted anonymous criticisms
of a corporation or public figure on the internet," according to
a coalition of privacy groups who are fighting to stop the
practice. find out more.


first take: msn 8.0 beta

redmond has been talking up the newest version of msn for months,
and now, the proof"s in the pudding. testers have their hands on
the beta of msn 8.0, and so far, this isp looks and works better
than past versions. the great no. 8 even has antispam tools and
improved parental controls. but will msn topple aol?


first take: icq lite alpha

one of our biggest beefs with icq has always been its bloated
feature set. now, the company has released a new lite icq that
sucks up far less system memory than the full-fat version--but at
what cost? we take an early look.
