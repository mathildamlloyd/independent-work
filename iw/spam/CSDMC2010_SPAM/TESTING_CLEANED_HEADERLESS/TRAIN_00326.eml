this automatic mail gives an overview over security issues that were recently 
fixed in debian testing. the majority of fixed packages migrate to testing 
from unstable. if this would take too long, fixed packages are uploaded to the 
testing-security repository instead. it can also happen that vulnerable 
packages are removed from debian testing.

migrated from unstable:
=======================
gnu-smalltalk 3.1-6:
cve-2009-3736: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2009-3736
               http://bugs.debian.org/559809

removed from testing:
=====================
the following issues have been "fixed" by removing the (source) packages from 
testing. this probably means that you have to manually uninstall the 
corresponding binary packages to fix the issues.
it can also mean that the packages have been replaced, or that they have been 
temporarily removed by the release team to make transitions from unstable 
easier.

how to update:
--------------
make sure the line

deb http://security.debian.org squeeze/updates main contrib non-free

is present in your /etc/apt/sources.list. of course, you also need the line
pointing to your normal squeeze mirror. you can use

aptitude update && aptitude dist-upgrade

to install the updates.
