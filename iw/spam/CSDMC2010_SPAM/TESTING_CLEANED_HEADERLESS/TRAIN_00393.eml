having to rely on the existence of the /etc/fstab to do any work is a  
bad choice.

i wasn't aware that the samplecontentfilter project has options to  
prevent mounting.

whatever solution is used must only allow the partition to be  
available where the software is installed and must do this  
automatically in the background.

i'm open to other solution if someone has one that works.
