hi,

i had the same problem with kdm, but no problem with gdm.

cheers

hi. installing gdm did not do the trick :=
(you must uninstall the kdm ser=
vice first and select in the session selector of gdm "kde". if yo=
u don't select the session type, get some errors.
i uninstalled kdm and s=
elected kde as a session but i got the same message telling me that my sess=
ion lasted lower than 10s and bla bla..=a0 
=a0
when doing startx as a normal user from console i get some errors like=
 "xkb could not initialize" and "xinit: no such file or dire=
ctory" and "xinit: could not connect to xserver"....
have you stopped the kdm firs=
t?yes i did stop kdm when=
 i tried that. the strange thing is that if i login as root from console an=
d do a startx then a kde session starts normally. if i do that as a normal =
user i get the errors.. 
can you paste the errors?=
when trying to login with gdm it has an o=
ption to view the .xsession-errors file. the error is mkdtmp: private folde=
r browsing (something like that :p): permission denied.
when i was using kdm and did a cat on the same file the second line jus=
t showed: permission denied. i checked the .xauthority file and did=
 chown to my user.i remem=
ber that first time i try to execute the startx with my user i=20
get some errors but not with root. the problem was that the /tmp=20
directory doesn't have permissions to write with my user. 

the correct permissions are:




cd /tmp 
ls -ld 
drwxrwxrwt=a0 8 root root 12288 2010-04-07 13:12 =
.
=20
could you check it?=a0


=a0

=a0




some friend told me to purge kde and reinstall it. i don't think th=
is will help. do you think i should give it a try?=a0
i tried that with no success :-(
if that didn't help you i will =
not bother..j 



well yesterday before i sent the list an ema=
il i used google to find anything that would help. i found someone reportin=
g that the permissions in /tmp and /var/tmp could be the problem. i checked=
 both. everything seemed fine :s=a0 i will check again, just in case.....
check the sticky bit.. is the important t=
hink.i think is:chmod 01777 /tmp chmod 01777 /var/tmp <=
br>i have just remember that i deleted al=
l contents of /tmp because some=20
files has the wrong permissions.... i have slow remembering memory =
:-d
