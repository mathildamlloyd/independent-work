yeah, i know the party line.  the evidence for it is extremely meagre.
new worlders had two entire continents and tens of millions of people,
which is a plenty big enough reservoir for infectious diseases to thrive
in.  their records show that they were plagued with them long before 1492.

take ireland in the early 1800s.  assume a population of circa 8
million.  take ireland around 1900.  assume a population not much
above 3 million.  ignore natural variations between mortality and
natality.  omit emigration.  observe the great famine in the middle.
deduce that it killed 5 million (actually about 1).  transpose to 16th
century mexico.  grossly inflate estimates of pre-contact population,
because nobody has a damn clue what it was anyway.  underestimate
later population levels.  deduce that 10's of millions died.  lather,
rinse, repeat.
