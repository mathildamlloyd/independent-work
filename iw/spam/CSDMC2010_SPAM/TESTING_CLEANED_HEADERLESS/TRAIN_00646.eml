hi all,

i have to make a backup plan for a server that is physically very far away
from me right now. if for some reason this server goes south, i have to have
a plan and it has to be done quickly. the problem is that the personnel that
is on site doesn't know squat about linux (or computers, for that matter),
so it must be something dead simple. i was thinking of getting a spare hard
drive, connect it to the working server, do a dd of the entire disk to the
new disk, and disconnect the disk (the people there can swap hard disks).
something like

dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=1024

assuming that sda is the working disk and sdb is the new, unformatted and
unpartitioned disk. so if hte machine breaks, i can get the new disk and put
in a new machine and everything should work. this server is doing firewall
and openvpn, etc, no x, no fancy stuff. is this going to work? what do you
guys think?

cheers!
