you are wrong on both counts. explanation is valid for symmetrical tcp, for
others see explanations below.

you should change that to: ... are always candidates for predictive or
preventive delay.

acks are delayed (per flow) in such a way that wan-bound traffic reaching
the edge router's ethernet interface does not exceed wan link speed (no
router queues!). it does not wait for the link to be at or near saturation
to act -- that is why, unlike queueing, it is predictive and not reactive.

it slows down the rate of transmission of sending hosts (on a per-flow
basis) to accommodate wan link speed limit and current network utilization,
rather than fill up queues at lan speeds and empty them at wan speeds,
eventually dropping the excess once the queue(s) fill up, informing hosts to
slow down their rate of transmission once queues are beyond a fixed
threshold (90%?).

rate control works equally well for outbound and inbound traffic. ever heard
of an effective queueing technology for inbound traffic? queueing packets
after they have crossed a congested link does not make much sense, does it?

re: ipsec/gre or other encapsulated traffic

it obviously cannot dissect ipsec/gre or other encapsulated traffic: it sees
the tunnel as one connection if the tunneling device is before the ps on the
lan side (vpn gateway and router are two separate devices, ps between them).
if the router does the tunneling, then the ps sees clear traffic. typically,
in an organization the first scenario would be the case at headquarters and
the second at branch offices. the ps at the branch sees traffic inside the
tunnel whereas the unit at hq sees all traffic as one tunnel which allows
full management of both tunneled and clear traffic at both ends.

udp and asymmetrical tcp (where the ps and router only see the outgoing
packet, return traffic coming back through a satellite downlink to a station
on the lan) are handled differently.

for asymmetrical tcp, it will time the release of packets to the receiving
device, thereby indirectly timing the release of acknowledgements by the
receiving host. this informs the sender's tcp/ip stack that it should slow
the release of packets because limited bandwidth is available.

for udp, it utilizes flow-based derivative random drop. it selectively drops
only one packet at a time from flows that are predicted to cause congestion,
which prevents heavy retransmissions and application timeouts.

icmp packets exceeding policy limits are dropped.

the real gain is manageability and control. a lan host only knows about the
state of its own connections and is oblivious to wan conditions until its
tcp/ip stack learns (when router queues are nearly full) that the wan is
congested. a ps will predict and inform the lan hosts' tcp/ip stacks of the
"speed limit to obey" for every connection (based on policies and network
conditions), avoiding congestion. control for asymmetrical tcp and udp may
not be as "tight" as for symmetrical tcp, but it does work.

queueing is akin to deploying cops only when traffic jams occur, vs. rate
control where cops are permanently deployed throughout town, communicating
with each other and with a central control point, predicting upcoming
congestion and regulating traffic, ensuring a smooth flow of traffic. if
there is potential for congestion, it will take a driver a hell of lot
longer to cross town with first approach than it will with the second. do
you agree?

umm, don't get me wrong here, but i think you've been fed a less-than-
accurate sales pitch.

let's ponder this for a minute.

the device works by delaying acks... that is: packets with the ack
flag set, right?

...

[letting this sink in for a while]

...

yes, all packets in an established tcp connection have the ack flag set.
so all packets except syns are candidates for delay when traffic limits
are exceeded? whoops.


okay, let's assume for a second that the packets aren't actually delayed,
but that the ack sequence numbers or tcp window size fields are re-written
(dicey). all you've accomplished is move the queueing (delaying) from
the traffic shaper to the endpoints. you still get l7-to-l7 delays. big
deal if it happens on the wire or in the stack. also, convincing endpoints
to do delays probably results in less-than-perfect shaping since stack
retransmit timings suddenly affect the actual bandwidth available rather
than having the shaper itself do it; the shaper knows exactly when there
is bandwidth available.

but this doesn't even begin to touch on other protocols like udp or
icmp. or, for that matter, ipsec/gre/whatever tunneled traffic.
neither of them have sequence numbers or window sizes that you can
manipulate.


so, i'm forced to conclude that the packetshaper either sucks in a major
way, or that your explanation/the explanation that you have been given of
it is wrong. (sorry.)

what i think happens is that the delay is <=2msec as long as traffic
limits aren't exceeded. this is reasonable. but when traffic exceeds
the limits, things will begin to be queued. now, with a well-behaved
tcp stack, this _will_ mean that it will fall back to lower transmission
rates; this is how tcp was designed, so that part isn't all wrong.

and, again, this kind of shaping isn't rocket science. that is not to
say that there are shapers out there that are just being plain dumb
(always queueing and the selecting what gets transmitted out of the
queue), but, well, i just can't see that you can get any smarter
than queueing when limits are actually exceeded.  _maybe_ you can do
a special case for tcp and try to offload some of the queueing on the
endpoints, but i really don't see the real gain in that.

from: jerry lynde 
subject: dnat with iptables question


howdy folks,

i've been scouring the online docs for solid info on how to accomplish dnat 
with iptables.

essentially, i have converted the ipmasqadm lines of the form...

ipmasqadm portfw -a -p tcp -l $web_out  http    -r $web_in      http

to iptables lines of the form...

$iptables -a prerouting -t nat -p tcp -d $web_out --dport 80 -j dnat --to 
$web_in:80

with the accompanying lines...


$iptables -a forward -i $intif -o $extif -m state --state 
established,related -j accept
$iptables -a forward -i $extif -o $intif -m state --state 
established,related -j accept
$iptables -a forward -i $extif -o $intif -p tcp -j accept

the last two lines seem functionally sorta redundant, but i threw em in in 
an effort to make this work.
so far, i am unable to show that it's working correctly... i even tried 
logging all packets...

$iptables -a forward -i $intif -p tcp -j log --log-level info
$iptables -a forward -i $extif -p tcp -j log --log-level info

but nothing show up in /var/log/messages or anywhere else for that matter. 
this is on a redhat 7.3 box.
any help, clues, flames, rt(his particular)fm, etc are appreciated.

i read the list, so please don't reply directly in addition to the list 
resposne.


thanks,

jer

you're missing the new state. the initial syn packet will not match with
either of the first two rules. it should match the third if it's inbound,
though.

you need to insert those logging rules above any accept, reject or deny
rules for them to be of any use. are you sure the packets are hitting the
box at all? try moving the log rules to the top of the forward chain,
introduce logging rules to the prerouting, postrouting, input and output
chains, and/or use tcpdump as well to see where the packets are travelling.
