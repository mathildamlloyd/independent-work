anyone have a copy of gill sans or bell centennial i can borrow? i wonder if 
i'll ever have $250 to spend on fonts. *update:* kevin marks[1], who is 
stupendously incredible for far more things than i can list here points out 
that it's _included with os x_. i knew mac os x included a lot of grat fonts[2]
, but i don't know how i overlooked this. (matthew carter, i'd be happy to pay 
you the two cents in royalties you probably get for selling $100 worth of 
fonts.)
