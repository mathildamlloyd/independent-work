after discovering an open wireless net available from his sofa, steven 
"hackers" levy interviewed lawmen, academics and wifi activists about the 
legality and ethics of using open wireless access points. 

    i downloaded my mail and checked media news on the web. when i confessed 
    this to fbi agent bill shore, he spared the handcuffs. "the fbi wouldn't 
    waste resources on that," he sniffed. now i know that if it did, it would 
    be hard to argue that i broke a law. what's more, i certainly didn't feel 
    illegal. becauseand this is the point of all that war-driving and 
    -chalking and node-stumblingwhen you get used to wireless, the experience 
    feels more and more like a god-given right. one day we may breathe 
    bandwidth like oxygenand arguing its illegality will be unthinkable.
