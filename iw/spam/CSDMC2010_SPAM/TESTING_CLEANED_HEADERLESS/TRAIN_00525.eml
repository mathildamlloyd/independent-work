i have no answer to your question, but i am wondering... what does 'lol'
mean here? is it some version of something, or did you simply put this over
there because you have some sense of humor and you like to make your
(somewhat old) config appear less depressing to the others' eyes?

... it's the hostname, but it is funny! i don't give a damn about what
others might think anyway, i'm just having fun with it, making some tests,
pushing my knowledge...

my impression exactly, but i'd like to be sure : if i scrape this install,
i'll have a hard time recovering it...

i had to doublecheck to make sure i wasn't jumping any major, thanks for
that insight; i already knew what chip was inside the laptop, i'm just not
sure what and where to look for to know which kernel to choose. if you can
point me in the right direction, i would really appreciate it!

tankiou all! :o)
