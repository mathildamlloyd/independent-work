if you look at the /etc/fstab -

you have something that will read cd (iso9660) and dvd (udf) format for
a device mounted at /media/cdrom0 in this case.

gnome automount daemon or equivalent would find it there and offer to
open it for you.

in root ( /)
=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d

in /, you may have a symlink which points cdrom -> /media/cdrom

further down in the filesystem, under /dev, udev or its equivalent
normally points an alias to the same physical device during the
installation process.

in /dev
=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d
in my case /dev/hda is the physical device, so in /dev, cdrom is linked
to hda as is cdrw - all pointing back ot /dev/hda

ls -al cdrom gives

cdrom -> hda

same for dvd. [dvd, dvdrw]

if you want to mount something temporarily e.g. to copy something off an
.iso image (it's also worth looking at and learning how to loop mount a=
n
.iso image), something like the following as root where /tmp/tempcd is a
temporary mountpoint you'll remove later.

mkdir /tmp/tempcd

mount -t iso9660 /dev/hda /tmp/tempcd

cp /tmp/tempcd/* /home/<username/

so the second line is the equivalent of the mount command you normally
have in your /etc/fstab
