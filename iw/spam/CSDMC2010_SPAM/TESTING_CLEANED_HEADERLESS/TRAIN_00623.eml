subject: [satalk] 2.41/2.50 spamd/spamc problem


i noticed that after upgrading to 2.41 (or 2.50) from 2.31, the -f
option was removed from spamd. 

this is fine because all of the html format mail seems to arrive
properly. however, messages that get tagged as spam arrive as just html
source.

is there any way around this? i would like all html/rtf messages to
retain their formatting even if they are flagged as spam. i would
accomplish this on 2.31 by using the "-f 0" flag when starting spamd.

thanks!

regards,
