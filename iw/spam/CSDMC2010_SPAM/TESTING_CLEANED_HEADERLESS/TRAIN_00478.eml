"expect a 3 percent to 5 percent boost with pc1066"

5% faster for only 4 times [pricewatch at 7:55pm - 93 vs 379] the cost.

gimme gimme gimme! and i better get the full 5% speedup.

and gime me that 20% faster geforce 4600 at twice the cost of the 4200 too.

seriously, who falls for this scam?

p.s. finished the ps2 port, it benchmarks at fp:1 int:40. a celeron 525
benches at fp:460 int:400... if it's not a polygon fill the thing is
useless. there will be no beowolf cluster of these. it is 3x faster then
the ipaq tho at 1/13 :)
