over at appleusers.org, we have been updating our list of active apple =20=

user groups in australia as we=92ve recently seen one group fold, =20
another start up and a few whose details had changed and we thought =20
this would be an opportune time to seek any other active apple user =20
groups that may wish to be included in our listings.

in particular, we are looking for any groups in tasmania (after all, =20
the apple isle should have apple user groups :) ) and in the northern =20=

territory as we have no active groups recorded for those regions at =20
present.

we are also interested in hearing from =91pc-based=92 groups that also =20=

have special interest groups for mac, ipod, iphone or ipad users.
or maybe you are a u3a or seniors computer club that has a dedicated =20
session for the users of apple products? if so, we are happy to =20
include you in our listing.

to see if your group is listed with us, visit the appleusers.org user =20=

group listing page and if your group isn=92t listed, we don=92t know =
about =20
you :( so fill in the form at the bottom of the page and we=92ll add =
you.

if your group is listed, you might as well take the opportunity to =20
confirm that we have your web address correctly listed. if we don=92t, =20=

then just fill out the form again.
