hello,

has anyone made a working source rpm for dvd::rip for red hat 8.0?
matthias has a spec file on the site for 0.46, and there are a couple of
spec files lying around on the dvd::rip website, including one i patched
a while ago, but it appears that the makefile automatically generated is
trying to install the perl libraries into the system's, and also at the
moment dvd::rip needs to be called with perlio=stdio as it seems to not
work with perlio on rh8's perl.

not too sure what the cleanest way to fix this is - anyone working on
this?

thanks,
