yeah, i was thinking of the g4 keyboard when i wrote this. otherwise lousy
feel and key placement, though. (that's why i'm holding on to my ibm model
m space saver. once i get an ps2 to usb converter, i expect it will
outlive several generations of computer hardware).

very good for sticking in usb fobs into, though. crts/lcd panels are even 
better for that, though.

i think laptops are largely useless because of the battery and the 
keyboard issue.
