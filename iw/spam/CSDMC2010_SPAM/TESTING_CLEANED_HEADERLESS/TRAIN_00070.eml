since libdvdcss-1.2.0, i have been unable to play dvds using ogle, xine,
vlc, or mplayer.  they all show a scrambled picture with (very) choppy
audio.  when i run xine i see tons of these in the console: 

liba52: a52_block error
liba52: a52_block error
liba52: a52_block error
liba52: a52_block error
audio_out: inserting 5859 0-frames to fill a gap of 10989 pts
metronom: audio jump
liba52: a52_block error

has anyone seen this before and know how to fix it?  or should i file a
bug report?  

thanks for your help.
