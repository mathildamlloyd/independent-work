battery pack, huh what???

you dont use batteries for a 1/4 mile run, you use capacitors. many times
the energy density, and you can get the energy out fast enough. note that
the battery packs are fully swapped out for recharging after each run
anyway, just like a gas dragster is refueled, so this wouldnt be cheating.
200 mph should be no problem.
