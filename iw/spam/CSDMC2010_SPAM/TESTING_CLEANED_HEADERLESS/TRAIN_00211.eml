=09=09=09dear readers,
=09=09=09
your isp, if it's anything like mine, works like a very large
boat: it moves slowly, it turns slowly, and sometimes it leaks.
take rogue wireless networks, for example. for many months now,
some mischievous entrepreneurs have been hacking into major isp
networks and siphoning off bandwidth for neighborhood wireless
networks. only now, months later, are broadband bigwigs doing
something about it. and what
about isp hackers? could they break into your service provider?
probably. thankfully, you can protect yourself against most of
these leaks. let dan tynan, our isp guru, show you how.

big broadband providers are ticked off about wi-fi hot spots.
in fact, both at&t broadband and time warner cable have begun
campaigns to stop subscribers from sharing their accounts with
others at no charge. also this week: we review yahoo"s new
dial-up service.


is your isp safe from hackers?

surely, the folks who run your isp have thought good and hard
about security issues, but should you count on their skills to
ward off intruders? not wise, says our isp expert. in this
week"s column, dan tynan takes security matters into his own
hands and shows you how to protect yourself.





domain names

your business, organization, or project. almost every transaction
on the internet relies upon a domain name to conduct commerce,
display web pages, deliver e-mail, and more. secure your own
domain here.
