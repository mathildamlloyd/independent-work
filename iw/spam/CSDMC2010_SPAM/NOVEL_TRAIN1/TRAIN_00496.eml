i fear newer drivers. 

the first time i installed nvidia proprietary drivers was 3/4 years ago. 
in that time i was running opensuse 10.1 and hopefully, nvidia provided 
rpm drivers in their site so installation went straightforward (very easy 
and worked fine: i needed 3d for running google earth and twinview setup 
for the two displays i had attached).

that time (and that time was 4 years ago) i installed the same drivers i 
have nowadays (173.xx). why i have not updated to the latest ones 
(195.x)? because "if it works, don't touch it" and i don't needed to do 
fancy things in that computer and the old version was (and is still) 
working without glitches.

yes, i have also encountered the "debian-way" plain easy. i thought 
installing nvidia drivers was going to be a headache but truly was not :-)
