gotta wonder what the gpg config stuff in ~/.exmh/exmh-defaults looks 
like.  also gotta wonder what the message headers in the offending 
message are saying to nmh/exmh.  my set-up works perfectly.  that is, 
i get a pop-up window to enter my passphrase into, and when i type it 
correctly, the message display changes from a prompt to click to 
decrypt to the message content.

ttfn....

hmm - i'm cc'ing the exmh-workers list, because i really don't know
much about the various pgp interfaces.  i think there has been some
talk about "issues" with the latest version of gpg.
