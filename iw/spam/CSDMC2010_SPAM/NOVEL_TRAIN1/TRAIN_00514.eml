when i tryed to install simutrans game with aptitude i got
this error and was not able to install it:


e: failed to fetch cdrom:[lenny dvd                                       
   3]/pool/main/s/simutrans/simutrans-data_100.0+ds1-4_all.deb: hash sum  
   mismatch                                                               
                                    [ ok ]                                


a few days ago same thing happend when installing hgsvn:


e: failed to fetch cdrom:[lenny dvd                                       
   3]/pool/main/h/hgsvn/hgsvn_0.1.6-2_all.deb: hash sum mismatch          
                                    [ ok ]                                


i have original dvds. content of /cdrom/.disk/info is:
debian gnu/linux 5.0.4 "lenny" - official i386 dvd binary-3 20100131-19:16

any idea why this is so?

martin
