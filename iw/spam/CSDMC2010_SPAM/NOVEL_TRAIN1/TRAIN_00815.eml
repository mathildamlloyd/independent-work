  by stelian pop (http://freshmeat.net/users/spop/)
  tuesday, july 30th 2002 12:57

system :: archiving :: backup
system :: archiving :: compression
system :: filesystems

about: the dump package contains both dump and restore. dump examines
files in a filesystem, determines which ones need to be backed up, and
copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other storage medium. the
restore command performs the inverse function of dump; it can restore a
full backup of a filesystem. subsequent incremental backups can then be
layered on top of the full backup. single files and directory subtrees may
also be restored from full or partial backups.

changes: this release fixes a bug (introduced with 0.4b29) which prevented
the use of a remote tape drive.

robustness. included with this package is the print plugin for the gimp
(hence the name), a cups driver, and two drivers (traditional and
ijs-based) for ghostscript that may be compiled into that package. this
driver package is foomatic-compatible and provides foomatic data to enable
plug and play with many print spoolers. in addition, various printer
maintenance utilities are included. many users report that the quality of
gimp-print on high end epson stylus printers matches or exceeds the
quality of the drivers supplied for windows and macintosh.

changes: this release fixes a serious and longstanding problem whereby
prints to certain epson printers hosted on a windows system are
incomplete; the bottom of the last page of the print is chopped off. there
are also some minor tweaks for the epson stylus photo 2100/2200.

[046] - lindenmayer systems in python 1.0 
  by eleventh hour (http://freshmeat.net/users/xihr/)
  tuesday, july 30th 2002 17:52

scientific/engineering :: artificial intelligence
scientific/engineering :: mathematics
text processing :: general

about: lindenmayer systems in python provides a simple implementation of
lindenmayer systems (also called "l-systems" or "substitution systems").
in basic form, a lindenmayer system consists of a starting string of
symbols from an alphabet which has repeated transitions applied to it,
specified by a list of transition search-and-replace rules. in addition to
the standard formulation, two alternative implementations are included:
sequential systems (in which at most one rule is applied) and tag systems
(in which the transition only takes place at the beginning and end of the
string). despite being implemented entirely in python, for reasonable
rules on a modern machine, the system is capable of running thousands of
generations per second. lindenmayer systems are found in artificial
intelligence and artificial life and can be used to generate fractal
patterns (usually via mapping symbols from the alphabet to turtle
commands), organic-looking patterns that can simulate plants or other
living things, or even music.

[059] - ossp cfg 0.9.0 
  by ralf s. engelschall (http://freshmeat.net/users/rse/)
  tuesday, july 30th 2002 19:01

software development :: libraries
system :: operating system
text processing

about: ossp cfg is a iso-c library for parsing arbitrary c/c++-style
configuration files. a configuration is sequence of directives, each
directive consists of zero or more tokens, and each token can be either a
string or again a complete sequence. this means the configuration syntax
has a recursive structure and allows you to create configurations with
arbitrarily-nested sections. the configuration syntax also provides
complex single/double/balanced quoting of tokens,
hexadecimal/octal/decimal character encodings, character escaping, c/c++
and shell-style comments, etc. the library api allows importing of a
configuration text into an abstract syntax tree (ast), traversing the ast,
and optionally exporting the ast again as a configuration text.

software development :: libraries
system :: logging

about: ossp fsl offers the syslog api otherwise provided by libc. instead
of writing to the syslogd process, it uses the powerful ossp l2 logging
capabilities. it is a drop-in link-time replacement which enables any
syslog consumer to take advantage of ossp l2 by just linking this library
in before libc. the program is intended to apply ossp l2 functionality to
existing syslog-based third-party programs without the requirement to
change the source code of the program.

  tuesday, july 30th 2002 19:01

software development :: libraries
system :: logging

about: ossp l2 is a c library providing a very flexible and sophisticated
unix logging facility. it is based on the model of arbitrary number of
channels, stacked together in a top-down data flow tree structure with
filtering channels in internal nodes and output channels on the leave
nodes. channel trees can be either constructed manually through
lower-level api functions or all at once with a single api function
controlled by a compact syntactical description of the channel tree. for
generating log messages, a printf-style formatting engine is provided
which can be extended through callback functions. the data flow inside the
channel tree is controlled by logging message severity levels which are
assigned to each individual channel.

[062] - papercut nntp server 0.8.3 
  by joo prado maia (http://freshmeat.net/users/jcpm/)
  tuesday, july 30th 2002 00:34

communications :: usenet news
software development :: libraries :: python modules

about: papercut is a multi-threaded nntp server written in python. its
main objective is to integrate existing web-based message board software
(phorum on the first few versions) with a usenet front-end. however, its
extensibility enables developers to write their own container for the
storage of the usenet articles (messages). that means that the code is
extensible enough that you could write new containers to integrate the
news server with other web message board projects or even other ways to
store the messages. 

changes: the various storage modules have been redesigned, and initial
code for nttp authentication was added. new features include a standalone
mysql storage module with no web front-end, an authentication module for
phorum, and the concept of a 'read-only' / 'read-write' server with
password protection. most (if not all) of the features are working.

is now possible. the menu is now somewhat more user friendly. webalizer
config files are now stored in a users' own directory, and the domains
belonging to each user are now tracked better.

[090] - tui-sh 1.2.0 
  by yeupou (http://freshmeat.net/users/mathieur/)
  tuesday, july 30th 2002 10:13

utilities

about: tui-sh stands for text user interface in a shell, and is a package
of miscellaneous scripts which are useful for a variety of purposes. they
are all designed to be faster and easier to use than the command line that
would normally be required to accomplish the same task. for example, there
are scripts for mass conversion of wav files to ogg files and ogg files to
wav files, for converting latex to postscript and viewing the output in
ggv, for creating image thumbnails, for converting from the euro to
another currency, and for automated updating via ftp. 

changes: this release features usage of gettext for internationalization
and getopt.

[092] - valgrind 1.0.0 
  by sigra (http://freshmeat.net/users/sigra/)
  tuesday, july 30th 2002 23:04

software development :: testing

about: valgrind is a tool that helps you find memory management problems
in programs. when a program is run under valgrind's supervision, all reads
and writes of memory are checked, and calls to malloc/new/free/delete are
intercepted. as a result, valgrind can detect problems such as use of
uninitialized memory, reading/writing of memory after it has been freed,
reading/writing off the end of malloced blocks, reading/writing
inappropriate areas on the stack, memory leaks in which pointers to
malloced blocks are lost forever, passing of uninitialized and/or
unaddressable memory to system calls, and mismatched use of malloc/new/new
[] vs. free/delete/delete []. 

changes: support for the x86 fldenv instruction, a fix for an obscure
optimiser bug causing failures like this: "insane instruction 27: putfl
%ecx", a fix for dying with bus errors running programs which mess with
the x86 ac (alignment-check) flag, fixes to make it compile and run on red
hat "limbo" (7.3.92), a fix for a possible assert failure having to do
with free() when running cachegrind (not valgrind), and final manual
adjustments.

about: vnc reflector is a specialized vnc server which acts as a proxy
between a real vnc server (a host) and a number of vnc clients. it was
designed to work efficiently with large number of clients. it can switch
between different hosts on the fly, preserving client connections. it
supports reverse host-to-reflector connections, it can save host sessions
on disk, and it also has other unique features.  

changes: handling of host connections with different desktop geometries
was improved, and support for dynamic changes to desktop size was
implemented. the ability to specify negative display numbers was added. a
few other new features were implemented, and a number of bugs were fixed.

  tuesday, july 30th 2002 11:07

communications :: email
communications :: email :: mail transport agents
communications :: email :: post-office :: pop3

about: vpopmail (vchkpw) is a collection of programs and a library to
automate the creation and maintenance of virtual domain email
configurations for qmail installations using either a single uid/gid or
any valid uid/gid in /etc/passwd with a home directory. features are
provided in the library for other applications which need to maintain
virtual domain email accounts. it supports named or ip-based domains. it
works with vqadmin, qmailadmin, vqregister, sqwebmail, and courier-imap.
it supports mysql, sybase, oracle, ldap, and file-based (djb constant
database) authentication. it supports smtp authentication combined with
the qmail-smtp-auth patch. it supports user quotas and roaming users (smtp
relay after pop authentication). 

changes: this release adds one last patch for the vgetent problem,
comments out the lseek definition for bsd users, replaces the old
qmail-pop3d-maildirquota patch with the qmail-maildir++ patch (which adds
maildir++ support not only to qmail-pop3d, but also to qmail-local), and
updates the documentation.

[095] - vstr string library 0.9.9 
  by nevyn (http://freshmeat.net/users/nevyn/)
  tuesday, july 30th 2002 00:14

software development :: libraries

about: vstr is a string library designed for network communication, but
applicable in a number of other areas. it works on the idea of separate
nodes of information, and works on the length/ptr model and not the
termination model a la "c strings". it can also do automatic referencing
for mmap() areas of memory, and includes a portable version of a
printf-like function.

changes: the vstr_export_buf() function now performs automatic bounds
checking in the same way as vstr_export_cstr_buf(). vstr_sc_read_*() now
works even if the vstr isn't configured to have an iovec cache. work on
internal symbol hiding has been made, making the library smaller and
faster.

uploading, downloading, etc.;  assists in directory navigation; and can
execute  any command for which the user account has  privilege.
filemanager also comes with a built-in  text editor for quick editing and
file updates. 

changes: a security hole that allowed authorized users to view any file on
the system has been fixed. the security certificate has been extended.
support has been added for 29 more os types. the find function now works
for non-root, jailed users. a new option controls whether or not a user
can "click" outside their home directory tree. the allowrootuser parameter
can now disable the 'root' user. a bug that prevented non-root, jailed
users from creating subdirectories, a "group" permissions access problem,
and a bug in the "command line" box which prevented using the asterisk
wildcard have all been fixed.
