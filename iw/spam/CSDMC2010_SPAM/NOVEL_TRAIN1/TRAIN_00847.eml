yup, i've been meaning to cobble together procmail + script for this, as 
a few google searches didn't turn up anything. did anyone here get there 
first?

(i guess i want a config file of mailboxes who normally sign their mail, 
and procmail that runs gpg and adds headers...)

fwiw, the 'enigmail' add-on for mozilla's mail client has it happily 
talking to gpg (and i believe pgp). you can choose how long it remembers 
your passphrase for, default is 15 mins.

see http://enigmail.mozdev.org/

this feature was enough to get my off my pine habit, since (to answer 
the original question) the combination of spamassassin and shared 
whitelists means that forged 'from:' headers are pretty much the only 
spam i see in my inbox now.
