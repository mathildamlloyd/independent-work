openssh-3.0.2p1-1

i think that is directly from openssh site. it's from the rh 6.2 that i 
upgraded to 7.2 (6.2 doesn't ship with openssh...). 

i probably should downgrade to the versoin rh provides except i can't do 
that as i don't have physical access to that box and downgrading ssh 
packages over ssh doesn't sound like a bright idea...
