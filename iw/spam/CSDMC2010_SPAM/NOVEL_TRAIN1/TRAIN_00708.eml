what about the carrot approach?  find an even better 
backup method, compatible with grub 2 and appealing 
to your management for its efficiency.

or what about putting grub on a usb flash which can 
be replicated easily and is largely independent of 
your main non-volatile storage.  the flash fails 
and you plug in another.  main storage fails and 
you invoke the traditional backup.
