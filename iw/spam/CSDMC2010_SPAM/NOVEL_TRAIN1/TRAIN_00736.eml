finally finished up (most of) tramp, my rdf interface for python. (if you don't 
use rdf or python you can probably safely skip this entry.)  

new in this version: rdf library abstraction (because rdflib's organization 
currently sucks), write values in addition to reading, and unit tests, all with 
that old tramp flavor you've come to know and love.  

_but wait,_ it also comes with an entire page of explanation/advertisement[1] 
if you're not already convinced.



    rdf/xml got you down? tired of having to go through contortions to deal 
    with data? want to write python and be standards-compatible at the same 
    time? need a module to implement the psuedo-code you had on your slides? *
    tramp may or may not be the answer to these problems!*



enjoy, and get a free bonus prize if you can tell me[2] why it's called tramp.
