package              : python-clamav
version              : 0.4.1-1.1~volatile1 (lenny)
importance           : medium

python-clamav, which provides python bindings to clamav, a virus scanning
engine, needed a recompilation with the newer clamav 0.95.3.  if you use
python-clamav directly or through nautilus-clamscan, we strongly recommend
you to upgrade to this version, as the old version the package was linked
against stopped working.


upgrade instructions
--------------------
