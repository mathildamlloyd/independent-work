after sending the report i started fiddling with the ftoc_rescanline 
stuff and i havn't seen it since. i can't really tell if it was my 
hacking that removed it, or if it was some transitional magic 
happening since this was the first invocation of that version of 
exmh. i've backed out my stuff now, and'll let you know if it happens 
again.


on another thing with the ftoc_rescanline stuff. this routine is 
called at times still unclar to me. an inspection of the routine 
suggests that it is used in the transition of a message to/form 
"current" state to re-paint the ftoc line. however, checking the 
msg.tcl code (msgchange) we find:

    if {$msgid != {}} {
        # allow null msgid from msg_showwhat, which supplies line 
instead
        if {$msgid < 0}  return
    } else {
        # line null too, try using first in folder
        if {[string length $line] == 0} { set line 1 }
        set msgid [ftoc_msgnumber [ftoc_findmsg $msgid $line]]
    }
    ftoc_clearcurrent
    mh_setcur $exmh(folder) $msgid
    ftoc_showsequences $exmh(folder)

the ftoc_clearcurrent calls ftoc_rescanline to clear the '+' sign 
_before_ the on-disk transition is made. i hacked this stuff and more 
or less changed the order. it works, but fails on some folder changes.

my feeling of this is that we really do not want to have a 
ftoc_clearcurrent, but rather just a rescanline and the caller had 
better know the line or msgid. that routine shoud just put in the '+' 
if the line/msg in question happened to be the cur msg. thoughts?
