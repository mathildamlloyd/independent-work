nothing really interesting there. just:

  auth name: mit-magic-cookie-1 id: -1

but 18:01:24 seems to be when i asked to restart gdm.

note that i do not think that x crashed entirely. i just mean that the
screen was looking like frozen, but screensaver was still
moving... slowly, or sometimes really slowly.
