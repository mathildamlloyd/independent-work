i too have been having issues with gl stuff (work just added some 3d =
stuff recently to our software). i just figured it was unsupported.=20

i'm running (under vmware) a fedora 12 x86_64 vm (no vmware tools =
installed)... i use ssh -x from osx to the vm.. i then tried the line =
you suggested:=20

[john@subvale ~]$ libgl_always_indirect=3d1 glxgears
x error of failed request:  badalloc (insufficient resources for =
operation)
  major opcode of failed request:  147 (glx)
  minor opcode of failed request:  3 (x_glxcreatecontext)
  serial number of failed request:  22
  current serial number in output stream:  24

i see a window created then disappear, and that error in my ssh session.

(i run other x stuff through that ssh session just fine.)
