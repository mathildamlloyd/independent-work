incorporation in the lilo package would be good.

unfortunately x remains broken with an error 
about /dev/fb0.

the log is here in case anyone is interested.
    http://carnot.yi.org/dalton.xorg.0.log
with minimal understanding, i noticed these lines.

(ii) primary device is: pci 00@00:02:0
(ww) falling back to old probe method for vesa
(ww) falling back to old probe method for fbdev
(ii) loading sub module "fbdevhw"
(ii) loadmodule: "fbdevhw"
(ii) loading /usr/lib/xorg/modules/linux/libfbdevhw.so
(ii) module fbdevhw: vendor="x.org foundation"
compiled for 1.7.6.901, module version = 0.0.2
abi class: x.org video driver, version 6.0
(ee) open /dev/fb0: no such file or directory

i've tried various ideas found with google.
remove the intel driver and leave the vesa 
driver installed for example.

is fb a standalone driver?  is it an accessory 
to the vesa driver?

thanks for any ideas,          ... peter e.
