Hello,

KDE SC 4.4.2 packages in qt-kde.debian.net have been superseded by packages=
=20
uploaded to official Debian experimental archive and therefore they were=20
removed from the semi-official repository. As it was written on the=20
introductory page of qt-kde.debian.net, the repository itself will remain t=
o=20
exist and might get some random extremely bleeding edge updates from time t=
o=20
time. Feel free to keep it in your /etc/apt/sources.list.
