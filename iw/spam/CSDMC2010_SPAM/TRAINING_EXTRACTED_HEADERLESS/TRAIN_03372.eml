I installed xserver-xorg-core-nouveau (1:0.0.15+git20100329+7858345-3) of
squeze.  My video card is an inbuilt one.
00:0d.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation C61 [GeForce 7025 /
nForce 630a] (rev a2)
But after switching xorg.conf to use "nouveau", there was error saying that
no video device found.
Finally I followed.
http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/InstallNouveau
Compiled both drm and xf86-video-nouveau and replaced both libdrm and
/usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/nouveau_drv.so
Now it is working fine.

Of course. But the problems I had with Gnome and Xfce on this system occurr=
ed not only in Squeeze, but also when running an Ubuntu LTS version and Deb=
ian Stable. I only saw those problems when using the restricted / glx drive=
rs. Never with nv or vesa. I think this is, perhaps, more a measure of the =
card itself than the drivers. But I know a number of people with &quot;high=
 end&quot; graphics cards from nvidia who have reported the same sorts of i=
ssues that I saw. It doesn&#39;t really matter much as these particular sys=
tems are no longer used as graphics workstations. As they&#39;ve aged we st=
uck Linux on them and use them as admin workhorses, a job for which they ar=
e admirably suited because of all of the screen real estate.<div class=3D"i=
