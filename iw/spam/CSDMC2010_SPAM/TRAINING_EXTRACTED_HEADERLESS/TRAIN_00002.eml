Bonding is not suitable for you because it works too low-level (it is=20
layer 2), unless you have two links from the same provider, using some=20
technology that can be bonded (like ADSL).

AFAIU what you need is BGP[1], but I can't give you any tips as this is=20
way out of my league ;)

Probably a good start (whatever technology you end up using) is a=20
GNU/Linux (preferably Debian) machine connected to both internet links=20
and your internal network since consumer gateways don't even have more=20
than one WAN port[2].

[1] http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol
[2] some of them could be used for this with custom firmware, but this=20
is off-topic
