Hi,
since this seems to be the time to complain about KDE, I'd like to ask for=
=20
help on an old issue: kded4 prevent the plasma weather applets from working=
=2E=20
When I login to my KDE session the weather applets fail to retrieve any dat=
a.=20
I've confirmed with Wireshark/TCPdump that there is no network traffic at t=
hat=20
time. As soon as I kill kded4 the weather applets startk working immedeatel=
y.=20
Is there are another workaround than killing kded4 (since that messes up so=
me=20
other things in KDE) or, even better, a fix available?

=2D-=20
Mit freundlichen Gr=FC=DFen / Best Regards
Dominik
