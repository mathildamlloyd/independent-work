The thing I miss most in KDE4 is: pausing the cursor over a music
file in Konq (file manager, icon view) and hearing the contents.
This was such an awesome feature that Microsoft has copied it for
Windows 7; and it's disappeared from Konq/Dolphin. I asked about it
once, and got <shrug> back.

Otherwise, I'm a happy KDE4.4 user (on a number of distros).

Any chance?
