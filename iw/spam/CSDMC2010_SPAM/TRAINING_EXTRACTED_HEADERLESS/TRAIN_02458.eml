Have you tried creating a new account and looking if it's there as well? =20
The menu is basically system wide, but users may customize it (and I=20
absolutely don't understand how system wide and local menu are merged.)

If it's not system wide, removing the right files from your ~/.kde, ~/.loca=
l=20
and/or ~/.config directories should probably cure the proble,  (If you=20
didn't do much customizing you can obviously nuke your whole configuration=
=20
but in my case, that would lose quite a few hours configuration work, not t=
o=20
speak of stuff like address book/calendar data etc. ...)

I have opinions of my own - strong opinions - but I don't always agree
with them.
