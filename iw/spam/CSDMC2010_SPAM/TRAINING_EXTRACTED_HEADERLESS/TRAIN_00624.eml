Say, that's a clever approach, thanks for suggesting it.

Can you clarify?  Listing all the functions in the current shell environment
solves my issue perfectly.. But less is just a pager, no?  Oh, wait, did you
mean "much less list"?   In which case, we're in the same boat, but I'm
hoping there is a solution I'm not aware of (even though my hopes are dim :)
)

That would work pretty much everywhere except bone-stock Solaris, where I
have no possibility of recovery -- "/bin/bash: bad interpreter: No such file
or directory".  At least if I use /bin/sh as my interpreter, I can always at
the very least output an error message.

I suppose my other alternative is roughly  [ -x /bin/bash ] && /bin/bash $0
$* && exit $?, and assume that everywhere-but-solaris has /bin/bash. Hmm.
If debian keeps bash around as a default package, even when dash-is-bin-sh,
then I guess I'm in fairly safe territory in that regard.

Thanks,
Wes
