IMHO, Debian seems to have the best record of successful upgrades. I run Si=
d
on several of my boxes, which means it is in a constant state of upgrade. O=
n
my workstation, with a very eclectic mix of software, I have only started
over from scratch twice in the last 10 years...Once in 2000 and once in
2007.
