With regard to the noise produced on the microphone when plugged into the
sound card, try the sound card drivers available here,
 www.opensound.com/oss.html . Thought by some to be superior to ALSA.

##### 2 - My microphone works with lots of noise.<br>
Hi! I have a problem with my microphone. It works with lots of noise and re=
corded sound is very-very quiet or simply there is no sound but only rhythm=
ical crack. This result changes when I change in alsamixer L R Capture para=
meter (Capture [dB gain=3D6.00, 6.00] - lots of noise and quite sound, Capt=
ure [dB gain=3D30.00, 30.00] - rhythmical crack). Maybe this is a problem o=
f bad configuration. Who can help?<br>


I have not only one parameter but two parameters L R Capture and now I was =
talking about the first of them. When I turn the second parameter a bit up =
from null than that is a loud siren. Who knows this problem?<br>
<br>
This happens with my inner microphone in Acer 5220 and with my Microsoft Li=
fecam under Ubuntu 9.04 (Mint 7).<br>
This is about my sound card:<br>
