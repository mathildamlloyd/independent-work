How about single user mode?  Are you able to get virtual console there.
Also try to disable gdm/kdm, see whether virtual consoles are working.

Thank you Hugo, I managed to compile the proprietary driver.<br>
Now every ctrl+alt+Fn leads to a complete black screen, with no prompt or c=
ursor or anything.<br>
Ctrl+alt+F7 works as expected.<br>
Could it be that my system stopped creating the consoles at boot time ?<br>
