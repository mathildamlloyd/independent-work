yep external keyboard - does that make a difference !

I don;t need to do that, my laptop autoamically picks the external monitor
if the lid is closed - on boot up

yep this doesn't work on mine, plus I want to do it from software. I would
like a xrandr for the console if such a thing exists

I don&#39;t have your hardware, but I would assume that some function<br>
is provided on your laptop to do what Fn+F7 does on mine.<br>
<br>
When I do things this way, the X server picks a decent vertical<br>
refresh rate (about 75 Hz) for my CRT-based external monitor.<br>
I leave the lid open and use the internal keyboard for everything.<br>
The internal display is black from the moment I press Fn+F7 the<br>
one and only time. =A0I leave the lid open and I use the internal<br>
