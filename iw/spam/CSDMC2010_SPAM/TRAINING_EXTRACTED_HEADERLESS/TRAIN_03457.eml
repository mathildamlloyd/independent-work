=2E.. and, sending the last mail: is it a Debian specific issue, or some lo=
cal=20
feature of my KDE profile, or a KDE bug: recently (4.3 to 4.4, but I'm not=
=20
sure exactly which updates triggered it), the pinentry window always comes=
=20
up behind the kmail windows when I sign email.  Confused me a bit at=20
first... (luckily it is still modal relative to the kmail window, so the=20
kmail composer gets greyed out, indicating that the pinentry might be=20
somewhere...)

pinentry-qt4 is 0.8.0-1.

cheers
