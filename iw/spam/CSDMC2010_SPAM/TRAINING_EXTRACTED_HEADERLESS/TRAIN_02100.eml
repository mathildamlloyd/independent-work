This is a very sane advice. I also started with a stable install, but=20
after some time I decided I can handle testing. The problem is not that=20
it's hard to run testing because it breaks, it is just a bit more likely =

to break in which case it is good to have some experience sorting out=20
the debris. For unstable, this is probably even more true.
