My girlfriend's Dell Mini's screen got cracked on a recent trip even though
we had it in a protective case and now the netbook is useless, because to
replace one of those screens basically requires taking the entire machine
apart and it's out of warranty.  My 6 year old Dell Latitude D800 on the
other hand, while weighing in about 3 times as much, is solid as a brick and
the screen has no flex.  After the Dell Mini lasted only 8 months, we've
decided no more netbooks.  But that's just our experience, I know netbooks
work well for some people.   I question their durability for using while
travelling though, which is kinda the whole point of the netbooks...
