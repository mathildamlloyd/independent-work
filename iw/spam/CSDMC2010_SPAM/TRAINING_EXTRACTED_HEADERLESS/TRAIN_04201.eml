Hi!

I=92m having strange display problems with several web browsers. Certain
layout parts (as borders or backgrounds) aren=92t at the appropriate
place; and they=92re moving if I hover them. I encountered this problem
with the following browsers:

 - iceweasel from lenny-backports
 - firefox downloaded directly from Mozilla
 - epiphany from lenny-backports

This behaviour already occured before installing firefox; and it=92s not
caused by any plug-ins or add-ons as epiphany (which I didn=92t customize=
)
behaves the same (wrong) way.

To illustrate the problem, I made a screenshot of e. g. German Bash
Blog: web page [1], screenshot [2]. On other pages, there are similar
errors.

It would be great if anyone could tell me how to fix this or where to
ask for further help.

Best regards,
Robin
