Please, please, don't do this.

In 4.4, kmail depends on mysql-server in order to send mail. (kmail -> Akon=
adi=20
=2D> mysql-server).

In 4.3, this is not true.  From what I hear on upstream mailing lists, this=
=20
won't be true in 4.5.  Upstream is already aware and working on the issue, =
but=20
it falls under "new feature" so it won't be included in the 4.4.x line.

=46or me, KDE 4.4 is the most broken KDE release since 4.1 (I didn't try 4.=
0). =20
I'd rather have 4.3.x in Squeeze than 4.4.

Actually, I like most of KDE 4.4 and am currently using it for day-to-day=20
work.  I'm still using kmail/kontact/etc. (basically kdepim) from 4.3 since=
 I=20
have no desire to run yet another RDBMS on my system.  (I already run=20
PostgreSQL, and have a number of apps that use SQLite installed.)

Please don't force an "Akonadi-enabled" PIM suite on stable users before th=
ey=20
are provided with an Akonadi that can use something other than MySQL.
