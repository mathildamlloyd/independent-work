while a native connection is always best, we've used an epson document =
camera (purchased off ebay) for iphone/ipod presentations in the past =
and plan to do so next month for our ipad preso. for a new one i'd look =
at the elmo brand.
our epson can go to the projector and s-video out simultaneously so that =
we can capture the feed using an eyetv device for our recordings. again, =
quality is what it is, but it does work for us.

see our meeting using this method here:
