kmail doesn't use akonadi at all in kde 4.4. it might use akonadi in kde=20
4.5. the only thing using akonadi by default in kde 4.4 is the new=20
kaddressbook. afaik.

so kde 4.5 might even be more problematic in the beginning. especially=20
when i remember the roughnesses of kde 4.3.0 and kde 4.4.0 i do not=20
suggest to ship a .0 or even .1 release of kde. even kde 4.4.2 had quite=20
some bugs that kde 4.4.3 fixed.

so shipping kde 4.4.3 or 4.4.4 oder 4.4.5 imho could well be a better=20
option that to ship kde 4.5.0 with debian squeeze.

sadly i have not seen any kde 4.x.0 release yet thats really suitable for=20
debian stable.

ciao,
