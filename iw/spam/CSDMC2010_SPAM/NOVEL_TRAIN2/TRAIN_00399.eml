one possible solution is using the "nvidia-settings"-tool.
you can configure your display-settings in a gui and save it  
permanently to an xorg file.
i'm using this method since years and it works very well and flawlessly.

zitat von james allsopp :

> hi,
> i've a small 4:3 monitor which was working fine with debian at about
> 1152x864 (vga connection) on a nvidia 9500gt with the proprietary drivers
> (sorry want to experiment with cuda so non-free wasn't an option). however,
> i've just bought a new 1080p tv and connected it to the computer via hdmi.
> this unfortunately has permanently knocked the resolution down on the
> monitor to 800x600, which is next to unusable. would anyone with a similar
> configuration be willing to share an xorg.conf or share some advice on this.
> i think i'd like the monitor to be either 1280x960, 1152x864, 1024x768 and
> the tv to work at 1600x900 1366x768 or 1280x720.
