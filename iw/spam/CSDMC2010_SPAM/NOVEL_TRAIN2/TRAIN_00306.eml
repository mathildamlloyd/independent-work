yet he read much about the war. some of the recounted episodes deeply and ineffaceably impressed him. for example, an american newspaper correspondent had written a dramatic description of the german army marching, marching steadily along a great belgian high road--a procession without beginning and without end--and of the procession being halted for his benefit, and of a german officer therein who struck a soldier several times in the face angrily with his cane, while the man stood stiffly at attention. george had an ardent desire to spend a few minutes alone with that officer; he could not get the soldier's bruised cheek out of his memory.
good-evening once more, miss nowell, he said. 

i _might_, you knaoo! said marrier, brightening to full hope in the fraction of a second.general, the chouans have no doubt brought arms for those escaped recruits. now, if we try to outmarch them, they will catch us in the woods and shoot every one of us before we can get to ernee. we must argue, as you call it, with cartridges. during the skirmish, which will last more time than you think for, some of us ought to go back and fetch the national guard and the militia from fougeres.   what could it all mean? why that medium for her message? should he write and ask her? but what was there to ask or say, in the face of her silence? besides, he had not even her address. miss camilla could doubtless give him that. but would she? how much did she understand? why had she turned so unhelpful? .she wouldn't see him. she's very strong-willed.... that's a wonderful woman, hibody  io's voice shook a little.  
we can't stop their tongues, he said at last. ah! i did a foolish thing!  

she turned upon him the sparkle of golden lights in wine-brown eyes. it's a fairy bower. i'm going to do a bewitchment.  what makes you think it was colonel de peyster or any other english or tory officer who saved me from the indians? well, it wasn't. if colonel bird and your other white friends had had their way when i was taken i should have been burned at the stake long before this. it was the wyandot chief, timmendiquas, known in our language as white lightning, who saved me.  

 i beg your pardon, the stranger said, addressing him in pure and limpid english, which sounded to philip like the dialect of the very best circles, yet with some nameless difference of intonation or accent which certainly was not foreign, still less provincial, or scotch, or irish; it seemed rather like the very purest well of english undefiled philip had ever heard,--only, if anything, a little more so; i beg your pardon, but i'm a stranger hereabouts, and i should be so very much obliged if you could kindly direct me to any good lodgings.  yes, said she. the landlady wanted the money, she told me. so nellie gave me her share, and i paid it at once.

he belonged to that small minority of undemonstrative retiring natures, who are always at peace with themselves, and who are conscious of a feeling of humiliation at the mere thought of making a request, no matter what its nature may be. so promotion had come to him tardily, and by virtue of the slowly-working laws of seniority. he had been made a sub-lieutenant in 1802, but it was not until 1829 that he became a major, in spite of the grayness of his moustaches. his life had been so blameless that no man in the army, not even the general himself, could approach him without an involuntary feeling of respect. it is possible that he was not forgiven for this indisputable superiority by those who ranked above him; but, on the other hand, there was not one of his men that did not feel for him something of the affection of children for a good mother. for them he knew how to be at once indulgent and severe. he himself had also once served in the ranks, and knew the sorry joys and gaily-endured hardships of the soldier's lot. he knew the errors that may be passed over and the faults that must be punished in his men--his children, as he always called them--and when on campaign he readily gave them leave to forage for provision for man and horse among the wealthier classes.  master pillsbury pursed his lips and his expression became severe.  yes, i shall outlive it, else i should have little faith in myself. but i shall not forget; and if you would remain forever what you now are to me, you will so act that nothing may mar this memory, if it is to be no more. i doubt your power to forget an affection which has survived so many changes and withstood assaults such as geoffrey must unconsciously have made upon it. but i have no right to condemn your beliefs, to order your actions, or force you to accept my code of morals if you are not ready for it. you must decide, but do not again deceive yourself, and through whatever comes hold fast to that which is better worth preserving than husband, happiness, or friend.  what's the price, asked ellis, of the cigar and the compliment together? in other words, what do you want of me? 
a boat? lord, that sounds good! sighed banneker. 
'brian is not unkind to you, i hope?' cried bessie, prepared to be indignant. 


 by a new destroyer--a gentlemanly vulture, whose suave accents and perfect manners were fatal to the unwary. henceforth horatio cromie nugent paget flourished and fattened upon the folly of his fellow-men. as promoter of joint-stock companies that never saw the light; as treasurer of loan-offices where money was never lent; as a gentleman with capital about to introduce a novel article of manufacture from the sale of which a profit of five thousand a year would infallibly be realized, and desirous to meet with another gentleman of equal capital; as the mysterious x.y.z. who will--for so small a recompense as thirty postage-stamps--impart the secret of an elegant and pleasing employment, whereby seven-pound-ten a-week may be made by any individual, male or female;--under every flimsy disguise with which the swindler hides his execrable form, captain paget plied his cruel trade, and still contrived to find fresh dupes. of course there were occasions when the pigeons were slow to flutter into the fascinating snare, and when the vulture had a bad time of it; and it was a common thing for the captain to sink from the splendour of mayfair or st. james's-street into some dingy transpontine hiding-place. but he never went back to tulliver's-terrace, though mary anne pleaded piteously for the payment of her poor mother's debt. when her husband was in funds, he patted her head affectionately, and told her that he would see about it--i.e. the payment of mrs. kepp's bill; while, if she ventured to mention the subject to him when his purse was scantily furnished, he would ask her fiercely how he was to satisfy her mother's extortionate claims when he had not so much as a sixpence for his own use.
