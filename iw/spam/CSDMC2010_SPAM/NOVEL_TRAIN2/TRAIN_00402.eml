cool, one less package to maintain :)

one interesting thing about alsaplayer is that redhat's xmms package in rh8 will
probably not play mp3 files. but alsaplayer does play mp3s "out of the box".

also, they are developing rapidly in their cvs and looks like their next version
of alsaplaer will be pretty cool, but i have no idea when it will be ready.
