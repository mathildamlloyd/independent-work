hello people,

i am new to sa but (2) problems i do have.

i run sa from my own home for personal use and it seems to work but i see this
in my procmail log:



procmail: executing " ~/bin/spamassassin/spamassassin -p -c ~/bin/spamassassin/rules"
dccproc: not found
dccproc: not found


can someone enlighten me on why i get that? freebsd 4.6-stable, sa-2.3.0



secondly, i've tested (now on three boxes) sa for site-wide usage but i believe i am
missing something major because i've also had my setting checked/verified.

the problem is that the site-wide setup does not seem to work. why?

1. i have my local.cf in /etc/mail/spamassassin
2. i have spamd running, and mail delivery logs show that all e-mails are
   being passed thro sa.

my local.cf contains:

enabled=1
options="-f 0"

#
rewrite_subject         0
report_header           1  
defang_mime             0
required_hits           7.0
report_header           1
use_terse_report        1
subject_tag             **spam**



wash ('tty') ~ 337 -> exim -bt engingwarez@runjiri.co.ke
eng.ngware@runji.co.ke
  deliver to enginngware in domain runjiri.co.ke
  director = spamcheck_director, transport = spamcheck


however when i check the mail delivered to this mailbox, sa has _not_ added any headers
to it.

pertinent: i also run a virus scanner called drweb via exim's system filter and the rules
that i have applied are:

if not first_delivery or
    $received_protocol is "drweb-scanned" or
    $received_protocol is "spam-scanned"
then
  finish
endif


some enlightenment would bail me out, i believe.

thanks
