if the situation in egypt is anything
like the situation in the philippines,
it's because people (due to a strange
desire for jobs) squat on land which
they don't own.*

for people to be able to buy their own
land, capitalism must be healthy, but
not triumphant; there need to be too
many capitalists, not too few.

(how well off were the major landowners
in india before independence?)

* in the us, we are not so friendly to
our capitalists: adverse possession is
only supposed to take 5 years.

(how much do we owe to our frontiers?
heck, in egypt didn't they pretty much
invent geometry a few millenia ago to
keep track of their property lines?)
