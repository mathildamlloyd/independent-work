well, it wouldn't be my own vanity list if i didn't forward at least a 
little purely self-interested data.

this week is my europe week. in classic travelman fashion, i'm hitting 
two nights each in paris, london, hamburg, and copenhagen.

i get to cure rob's brain-pains this weekend, though at risk of missing 
the big concert in london sunday :-(

i'll be visiting a cousin-in-law (my cousin's visa is still in the 
works... a looong process).

the next stop is to visit a cousin's family proper, and a niece i 
haven't met since she was born 3-4 years ago. should be a blast!

finally, friday and saturday of next week will be copenhagen for 
henrik's second wedding... to the same woman, tho! :-)

bon voyage,
   rohit

ps. yes, it's egotistical to wish oneself a "bon voyage". screw it, it's 
my list, dammit!
