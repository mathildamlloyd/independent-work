so, do you have the two vga cards enabled? i also have an intel embedded 
card but iirc, i disabled it in the bios as soon as i plugged the nvidia 
card (7600 gs).

otoh, it seems that device id corresponds to nvida 9400 gt. so i would 
test with the nvidia debian drivers. if they do not work, you can always 
come back and activate the intel one.
