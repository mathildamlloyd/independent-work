it doesn't matter what the remote system is, as long as it has telnet, =
which i'm assuming it does, since that's what you originally asked =
about. =a0to be able to help, we would need to know the output you are gett=
ing when you run it, and probably the contents of the expect script that yo=
u are using (edit out any passwords).
