 i decided to try out gargnome, to see what gnome2 looks like. it's
pretty, i'll give it that.

 however, there seemed to be loads of bugs - sawfish threw wobblers all
over the place, so i tryed out metacity - which doesn't have a gui
configurator, and arsed if i'm going back to the fvwm days when you had to
set settings by hand, without an idea what the values looked like.

 so, i went back to 1.4 - and now sawfish can't start applets (yes, i did
change the ld_library_path back) and the panel can't make new workspaces.

 any ideas what could have happened ? would sawfish 2.0 silently change
the config files & break them?
