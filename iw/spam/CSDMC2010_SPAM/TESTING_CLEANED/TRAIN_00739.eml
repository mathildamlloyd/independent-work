I second Ron's point=2E  If you are trying for certification to "obtain
the knowledge" you'd be better off IMHO to spend the time on the
system or with other sys admins=2E  Certification usually is nothing
but a "stripe" on your resume and is not necessarily indicative of
your knowledge-it may help in a job search, however=2E
