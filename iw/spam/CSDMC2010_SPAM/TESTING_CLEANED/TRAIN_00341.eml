NoneOh my...Hello fork,

  So they have Aaron Schwartz on NPR's Weekend Edition talking
  about Warchalking.   I'll agree, its funny, his voice is squeaky and
  I'm jealous that he got on radio and I didn't...

  But really, WTF is the big deal about warchalking?  I have yet to
  see any of it, anywhere.

  LInk will probably pop up on www.npr.org later today.
