I assumed he had done that (it's what I asked him to do), in which
case the reported behaviour indicates something odd going on. Of
course, the xev output he posted came from the mouse leaving the xev
window, so maybe you're right and he misunderstood the instructions.

So, to make it even clearer: Move the xev window if necessary so it
doesn't cover the terminal window. Middle click in it, preferably
without moving the mouse, even a little. You should now see the mouse
click event in the terminal window. The moment you move the mouse,
tons of movement events will roll in and scroll the click events right
out of the terminal window.
