Would you happen to have any links to such benchmarks, unofficial or
otherwise?

My experience has been that whenever I look at filesystem benchmarks,
they skip the many-small-files case.  I've always had the feeling that
most of the big filesystems cared a lot about scaling up in file-size,
but not too much about anything else.

I'm a Reiser3 user myself, and I've never had any problems with it.

(The trouble with it being "long in the tooth" is mostly hypothetical,
isn't it?)
