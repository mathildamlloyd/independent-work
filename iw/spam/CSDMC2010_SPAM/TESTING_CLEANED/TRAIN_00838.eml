I have images of Marc in well worn combat fatigues, covered in mud, 
sweat and blood, knife in one hand and PSION int he other, being 
restrained by several other people, screaming "Let me at it! 
Just let me at it!"  Eichin standing calmly by with something 
automated, milspec, and likely recoilless.
