In my experience it's probably better to use an external database 
(MySQL) with amarok because it's faster to load. Anyhow, it still 
happens that the changes you make to the tracks/albums don't show 
immediately in the database. Bye

in my experience it's probably better to use an external database 
(mysql) with amarok because it's faster to load. anyhow, it still 
happens that the changes you make to the tracks/albums don't show 
immediately in the database. bye
