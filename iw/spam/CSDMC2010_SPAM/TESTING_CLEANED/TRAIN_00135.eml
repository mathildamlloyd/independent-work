Hey, look at that!

       DROPPRIVS   If  set  to	`yes'  procmail  will drop all privileges
		   it might have had (suid or sgid).  This is only
		   useful if you want to guarantee that the bottom half
		   of  the /etc/procmailrc file is executed on behalf
		   of the recipient.

Of course, removing setuid/gid bits on programs that don't need it is
always a good idea.  A general rule of system administration: don't give
out permissions unless you absolutely need to.   ;)
