You choose to have your email client do that.  You don't have to.  Short
of Palladium, you can do whatever you want with bytes you hold, including
reading messages and erasing the traces.  I'll buy a chocolate sundae for
anyone who can show otherwise.

An attacker might be able to verify that you *have* read a message (e.g.  
by seeing that you saved and edited a copy) but not that you *haven't*.  
If your email client was compromised you could put a packet sniffer on the
line before downloading mail.  If an attacker installed a packet sniffer
sniffer, you could run it in a spoofing VM.

The only exception to the rule that your machine belongs to you is --
maybe -- Palladium.
