I'm running (under VMWare) a Fedora 12 x86_64 VM (no VMWare tools =

[john@subvale ~]$ LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=3D1 glxgears
X Error of failed request:  BadAlloc (insufficient resources for =

  Major opcode of failed request:  147 (GLX)

I see a window created then disappear, and that error in my ssh session.

(I run other X stuff through that ssh session just fine.)

re: xquartz 2.5.0_rc2i too have been having issues with gl stuff (work just added some 3d =
stuff recently to our software). i just figured it was unsupported.=20

i'm running (under vmware) a fedora 12 x86_64 vm (no vmware tools =
installed)... i use ssh -x from osx to the vm.. i then tried the line =
you suggested:=20

[john@subvale ~]$ libgl_always_indirect=3d1 glxgears
x error of failed request:  badalloc (insufficient resources for =
operation)
  major opcode of failed request:  147 (glx)
  minor opcode of failed request:  3 (x_glxcreatecontext)
  serial number of failed request:  22
  current serial number in output stream:  24

i see a window created then disappear, and that error in my ssh session.

(i run other x stuff through that ssh session just fine.)
