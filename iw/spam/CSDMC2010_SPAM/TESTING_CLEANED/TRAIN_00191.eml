The easy way is just to install whatever Microsoft or whatever OS you
have in mind:  It should overwrite the MBR.  Indeed, the problem is
usually _preventing_ this from happening, as Microsoft Corporation's
installers seem to forever be overwriting your MBRs when you least wish
it, without asking your permission.
