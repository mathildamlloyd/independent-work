Yes, exactly.  We are hoping that, as we build our business and become
cash positive, a part of our profits can be used to shore up those areas
where FOSS is still weak as a desktop solution.  We have just put out
and received a response to our first bounty for fixing Kontact in KDE
3.5 so it is robust enough for Enterprise use and integration with
Zimbra.  A viable PDF editor is high on our list - John

yes, exactly.  we are hoping that, as we build our business and become

where foss is still weak as a desktop solution.  we have just put out
and received a response to our first bounty for fixing kontact in kde
