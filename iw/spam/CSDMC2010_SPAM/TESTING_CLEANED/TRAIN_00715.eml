Yes, the PLUS is the correct model. I will have to look into it again, 
but I have 3 drives so they could not all be in the two yellow ports. 
This may also explain why fdisk lists my drives in the order: sdc, sdb, 
sda. Running lspci -k, I don't recall seeing ata_piix at all.

Thanks for the input, I will have another look tonight.
