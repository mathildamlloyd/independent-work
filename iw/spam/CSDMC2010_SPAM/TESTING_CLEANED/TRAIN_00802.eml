Noneshoe horn KDE3.5 systemHi 
it sounds a bit weird but its pretty close to what I need to do.
As you can see from my footer I use mandriva and I like it.
I have however an app which does not.
It needs QT3 and KDE3.5 to run, anfd it has to be run in a KDE DM. It crashes
when run on gnome.I have made space in the middle of one of the two SATA drives.
There's about 100 GB it can use.
I have gone back on Mandriva releases and 2008.0 was the last to solely use
KDE3.5, if piklab finds a KDE4 lib it crashes, and from MDV2008.1 they merged.
MDV 2008.0 would be OK but it won't recognise SATA HDs.
I tried Ubuntu to try and load it in that 100 Gb gap, but it wanted all of the
drive, even when told use unused space.
I know Debian is stable, will the installer if told install its self on to an
unused section of the SATA HD and put its bootloader at the start of the rott
partition , ie" /", not /root.
Is the a version that used KDE3.5, QT3 that will work on a SATA HD, will the 32
bit versions run on a 64 bit or must I use the AMD_64 version.
Are the any problem with the kernel supplied with what ever version is
suggested with RTL8111/8168B PCI express ethernet cards, on MDV certain kernels
in 2009 had problems with the driver for that card.

A quick reply would really be appreciated, I've been trying to get this app to
run for the last couple of days without any luck.

TIA
