My concern doesn't stem from failing to understand how your business is
intended to work.  My concern is the lack of empirical evidence that it
will reduce the amount of uncaught spam.

Please don't misquote me.  I did not assert that you "can't track
spammers".  Here is what I said:

| It will be difficult to find, prosecute, and win money from someone in
| various non-friendly countries where spam originates (China is a good
| example) even if they do officially "respect" copyright law.

I understand the incentive that you have to pursue spammers, but that
does not directly translate to less spam being sent to my inbox.  It is
an indirect effect and the magnitude of the effect may not be sufficient
to counteract the ease with which a -20 score on the mark allows spam to
avoid being tagged as spam.

I think I've worked on SA enough to understand that I can localize a
score.  I'm just not comfortable with using SpamAssassin as a vehicle
for drumming up your business at the expense of our user base.

I think it would make more sense to start Habeas with a less aggressive
score (one which will not give spammers a quick path into everyone's
inbox) and after we've seen evidence that the system works, then we can
increase the magnitude of the score.
