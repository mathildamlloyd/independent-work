Sorry. I'm not thinking or communicating well. I'm using the vesa driver 
on the system, not nv. My brain was tracking back to an earlier 
experiment in which I was using other repositories. I use only main and 
security for Squeeze.

However, I have been showing xserver-xorg-video-nouveau in Squeeze main 
for a couple of days.

Too rich for my blood. By that I mean that nvidia-glx with this Quadro 
card has caused all sorts of odd breakages and unreliability issues in 
the DE. I have done enough experimenting with identical configurations 
of Xfce and Gnome on this system, with the only difference being use of 
different video drivers (vesa, nv, glx/restricted) under both Ubuntu and 
Debian to know that it's not my imagination. I'd rather have a reliable 
system than 3D, so glx is a no go for me. The vesa driver has been 
absolutely flawless, but quite slow, of course. The slowness has been 
worth it because absolutely nothing in the user interface has ever been 
broken since I went to vesa. I don't game, and I've just learned to be 
patient when switching workspaces.

;)

I'm looking forward to seeing if nouveau will be an improvement, 
performance-wise, without causing reliability issues.

I am, however, going to wait and install nouveau the easy way, once the 
upgrade to xserver-xorg-core becomes available in the repository. If 
this weren't my main system I might be tempted to experiment, but I just 
need this thing to keep working.
