NoneAutomated forwarding
Hi Folks,

I've been trying to set a button called which automatically
forwards mail using a '-form mycomps' without going through
the editor, but so far haven't got the right recipe.

I currently have in my .exmh-defaults:

*Mops.spam.text:        Spam
*Mops.spam.command:     Msg_Forward -form spamcomps -noedit -nowhatnowproc ; Msg
_Remove


I've also tried with "SeditSend {$draft $t 0}" after the forward command.
It should forward to a spam address (where filters get adjusted) and then
delete.  It does so, but not without producing the edit window.

Any help appreciated.
