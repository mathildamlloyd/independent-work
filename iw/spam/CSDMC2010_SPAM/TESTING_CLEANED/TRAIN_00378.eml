I create my PDFs (required for Reports and Specs) with OpenOffice <w=FCrg>

No, not the PDF stuff is <w=FCrg> but OOo which is  crap.  Switching  from
M$ Office to OpenOffice let you  increase  the  Psy-Bill  more,  than  a
dedicated computer with M$ Viasco plus Adobe Acrobat will cost.  Even if
you ONLY create PDFs with it.

Thanks, Greetings and nice Day/Evening

no, not the pdf stuff is  but ooo which is  crap.  switching  from
m$ office to openoffice let you  increase  the  psy-bill  more,  than  a
dedicated computer with m$ viasco plus adobe acrobat will cost.  even if
you only create pdfs with it.
